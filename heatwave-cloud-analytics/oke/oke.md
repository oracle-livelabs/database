# Provision OCI Kubernetes and MySQL HeatWave using OCI Resource Manager

## Introduction

In this lab, we will build the workshop environment using Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) and **MySQL HeatWave** using Terraform script with OCI Resource Manager. OKE will be used to deploy various open-source tools to connect and analyze data in MySQL HeatWave.

**Resource Manager** is an OCI service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will provision the following OCI resources using Resource Manager:

* Virtual Cloud Network with related network resources and policies
* Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes and a node pool with 2 worker nodes
* MySQL Database System
* An Operator Virtual Machine with kubectl and MySQL client tools installed

### Prerequisites

* You have an Oracle account
* You have enough privileges to use OCI
* You have one Compute instance having [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html) installed on it

## Task 1: Create Stack in Resource Manager

1. Visit the [Terraform scripts](https://github.com/rayeswong/terraform-oke-mds) in a browser, and click the image **"Deploy to Oracle Cloud"** at the bottom of the page. It would redirect you to OCI console to create a new stack in Resource Manager

2. Sign in to **Oracle Cloud** if you haven't yet. On the page of 'Create Stack', check to accept terms, give a name to your stack (e.g. "Analytics on OKE"), select the compartment (e.g. HOL-compartment) to provision OCI resources, and click **Next**

3. Review the values pre-populated for your OCI Resources, update the password for "MDS Admin User's Password" (default password: Oracle#123). Specify the [supported kubernetes version](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengaboutk8sversions.htm), for example, 1.29.1 and click **Next**.

    > **Note**: Oracle recommends that you use the most recent Kubernetes version that Container Engine for Kubernetes supports


4. Check **Run Apply** and click **Create** to create the stack and apply the Terraform scripts.

5. A job will be created to apply your Terraform scripts to provision OCI resources.

6. It takes about **20 minutes** to complete this job, you can click on your Terraform job to view logs of the progress of your job.

7. Once your job executes successfully, you can find the public IP address of your operator VM, and the private IP address of the MySQL Database from the outputs.

    >**Note** down these two IP addresses that will be used in the subsequent labs.

    You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
