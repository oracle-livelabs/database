# Create compartment

## Introduction

Before you start to provision any OCI resources, it is a good practice to create a **compartment** as an isolated environment for your work.
In this lab, we will create a compartment for all the OCI resources required to host our PHP application as well as MySQL HeatWave cluster

Estimated Time: 2 minutes

## Task 1: Create compartment

1. Log in to **OCI** and click on the **Hamburger Menu**![](images/hamburger.png) at the top left corner of the OCI console, and type **compartment** in the search box. Click on the **Compartments** in the search result

    ![compartment](images/compartment.png)

2. Specify the name of the compartment such as **PHP-Compartment** with a description, click on **Create Compartment**

    ![create compartment](images/create-compartment.png)

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
