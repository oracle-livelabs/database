# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop will cover the migration of a conventional LAMP stack application from any cloud or on-premises environment to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). We will walk you through the process of

* Deploying a conventional PHP/Apache/MySQL application to OCI Kubernetes and MySQL HeatWave
* Automating OCI resource provision using Terraform with OCI Resource Manager
* Loading data into MySQL HeatWave using MySQL shell utility and Autopilot features
* Speeding up SQL queries with MySQL HeatWave

### About Oracle MySQL Database Service

**Oracle MySQL Database Service** is a fully managed database service that lets developers quickly develop and deploy secure, cloud native applications using the worldâ€™s most popular open source database. MySQL Database Service is the only MySQL cloud service with an integrated, high performance and in-memory query accelerator,
**HeatWave**. It enables you to run sophisticated analytics directly against your operational MySQL databases and thus eliminating the need of complex, time-consuming, and expensive data movement and integration with a separate analytics database. **HeatWave** accelerates MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads. Optimized for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), MySQL Database Service is 100% built, managed, and supported by the OCI and MySQL engineering teams.

### About HeatWave

HeatWave is a distributed, scalable, shared-nothing, in-memory, hybrid columnar, query processing engine designed for extreme performance. It is enabled when you add a HeatWave cluster to a MySQL DB System.
