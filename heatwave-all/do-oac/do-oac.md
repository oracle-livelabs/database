4. Search for mysql and select mysql as the database

    ![MDS](./images/15oac09.png " ")

5. Specify the connections details

    - Specify the hostname of MDS in FQDN such as mysql-xxx.oraclevpn.com

    - be sure to use the oacadmin mysql user and password Welcome#123

    ![MDS](./images/mysql_config_connector.png "config connector ")

6. Next build the dashboard on MDS HeatWave by selecting Create->Data Set
7. Select the MySQL Connection created earlier

        count(*) as nbpeople
    FROM
        booking, flight, airline, passengerdetails
    WHERE
        booking.flight_id=flight.flight_id AND
        airline.airline_id=flight.airline_id AND
        booking.passenger_id=passengerdetails.passenger_id AND
        country IN ("SWITZERLAND", "FRANCE", "ITALY")
    GROUP BY
        airline.airlinename
    ORDER BY
        airline.airlinename, avg_age
    LIMIT 10;</copy>
    ```

9. Dataset screen
    ![MDS](./images/mysql_new_dataset_sql.png "add sql to dataset ")

10. Click the  save button and set the DataSet name to Passengers then click Create workbook button
