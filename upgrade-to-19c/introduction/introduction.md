# Introduction #

## About this workshop ##

**19c Database** is the current version Oracle promotes to customers and partners as the best target version for a database upgrade. Oracle 19c is the long-term support version and will be supported for at least four years after the initial release. After this, Extended support and Sustaining support will be available. This hands-on workshop focuses on **Upgrading your environment to 19c** demonstrating three scenarios that you can use (both on-premises and in the cloud) to upgrade your environment to 19c in a Container/Multitenant setup.

This hands-on lab can be run stand-alone but be aware that individual steps might take time to finish. Usually the hands-on lab is delivered as part of the PTS 19c Upgrade Workshop which fills the time waiting with explanations and information.

Estimated time: 3 hours.

### Objectives ###

- Learn to install a new Oracle 19c Home
- Upgrade a database by using the AutoUpgrade tool
- Upgrade a database using Full Transportable tablespaces
- Upgrade a database using unplugging a PDB and plugging it into a new 19c CDB (and upgrade)

### Prerequisites ###
