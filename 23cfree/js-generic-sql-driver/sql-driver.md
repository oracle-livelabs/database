# Interact with the database using the JavaScript SQL Driver

## Introduction

All previous labs have carefully avoided accessing the data layer to ease the transition into server-side JavaScript development. Beginning with this lab you will use the SQL Driver to access the database. Whilst this lab sticks with the basic concepts, the next lab focuses on JSON from a document model's point of view.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Learn about the built-in JavaScript SQL Driver
- Retrieve information from the database
- Perform an insert into a table fetching the auto-generated primary key in the process

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- An Oracle Database 23c Free environment available to use
- Created the `emily` account as per Lab 1

## Task 1: Get familiar with the SQL Driver

The SQL Driver is an integral part of the JavaScript Engine. It is very similar to the client-side driver, `node-oracledb` to ease the transition from client-side code to an implementation within the database. Connection management is the main difference between the two. In a client-side JavaScript environment a database connection has to be established explicitly. This is not necessary in the server-side environment because it executes in an existing database session.

The SQL API is provided in the `oracledb` object which can be obtained in two different ways:

- Either by importing `mle-js-oracledb` explicitly
- Or by using the global constant `oracledb`

Both of these will be explained in depth in this lab. Refer to the Server-Side JavaScript API Documentation for more details about the `oracledb` object.

## Task 2: Querying the database

By completing this task, you will learn more about selecting information from the database.

1. Create a database session

    Connect to `freepdb1` just as you did in the previous labs, don't forget to substitute the dummy password with your own

    ```bash
    <copy>sqlplus emily/yourNewPasswordGoesHere@localhost/freepdb1</copy>
    ```

2. Query the database by importing `mle-js-oracledb` explicitly

    ```js
    <copy>
    create or replace mle module sql_driver_lab language javascript as

    import oracledb from "mle-js-oracledb";

    export function whoAmI() {
        // link the JavaScript SQL Driver to the existing session
        const connection = oracledb.defaultConnection();

        // execute the query, providing 
        // - the SQL text
        // - bind variables (there are none in the example)
        // - additional options to execute()
        const result = connection.execute(
            'select user',
            [],
            {
                outFormat: oracledb.OUT_FORMAT_OBJECT
            }
        );

        return result.rows[0].USER;
    }
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    > **Note**: Unlike `node-oracledb` the default `outFormat` for the MLE JavaScript SQL Driver in 23c Free is `oracledb.OUT_FORMAT_OBJECT`.

3. Query the database using global constants

    A number of variables have been added to the global scope to enhance the developer experience. In this example you can learn how to re-write the previous module to make use of the variables in the global scope.

    For a complete list of available global variables, see JavaScript Developerâ€™s Guide, chapter 6.

    ```js
    <copy>
    create or replace mle module sql_driver_lab language javascript as

    // note the absence of the import statement

    export function whoAmI() {

        // there is no need to grab the defaultConnection()
        
        // execute the query, providing 
        // - the SQL text
        // - bind variables (there are none in the example)
        // - additional options to execute()
        const result = session.execute(
            'select user',
            [],
            {   // oracledb is also available in the global scope
                outFormat: oracledb.OUT_FORMAT_OBJECT
            }
        );

        return result.rows[0].USER;
    }
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    There are a few noteworthy differences in the code:

    - Because `oracledb` is part of the global scope there is no need to import it
    - The `session` object refers to the default connection you'd otherwise have to obtain using an extra line of code

4. Use a `ResultSet` rather than a Direct Fetch

    The previous examples demonstrated direct fetches. In other words all results are returned in the `result.rows` property. This can cause strain on the available memory if the result set is large. A more efficient way to fetch larger result sets is available in the form of the `ResultSet`.

    Create a sample table with some data first.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    create table result_set_demo_t as 
    select 
        * 
    from
        all_objects;
    </copy>
    ```

    Next create an inline JavaScript function to iterate over the table. Inline JavaScript functions only permit importing modules built-into MLE _dynamically_ (see below for the API reference). Because dynamic imports require additional language elements to be used it is easier to refer to the `oracledb` and `session` objects in the global scope.

    ```js
    <copy>
    create or replace procedure result_set_demo 
    as mle language javascript
    q'~
    const result = session.execute(
        `select
            owner,
            object_name,
            object_id
        from
            result_set_demo_t
        fetch first 100 rows only`,
        [],
        {
            resultSet: true,
            outFormat: oracledb.OUT_FORMAT_OBJECT
        }
    );

    const rs = result.resultSet;

    // use the iterable protocol with the resultSet
    for (let row of rs) {
        console.log(`${row.OBJECT_ID}    ${row.OWNER}    ${row.OBJECT_NAME}`);
    }

    rs.close();
    ~';
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    When executing the procedure you will see the first 100 lines of the table printed to your screen.

5. Using Bind Variables

    So far none of the examples in this lab have made use of bind variables. Bind variables must be passed as the second argument to the `execute()` function and they can be provided as an array or an object. This tasks makes use of the simplified syntax offered by an array. Note that the order of the variables inside the array representing bind values must be aligned with the placeholders from the query text.

    ```js
    <copy>
    create or replace procedure result_set_demo_binds(
        "p_object_id" number
    )
    as mle language javascript
    q'~
    const result = session.execute(
        `select
            owner,
            object_name,
            object_id
        from
            result_set_demo_t
        where
            object_id = :p_object_id`,
        [
            p_object_id
        ],
        {
            resultSet: true,
            outFormat: oracledb.OUT_FORMAT_OBJECT
        }
    );

    const rs = result.resultSet;
    let numRows = 0;

    // use the iterable protocol with the resultSet
    for (let row of rs) {
        console.log(`${row.OBJECT_ID}    ${row.OWNER}    ${row.OBJECT_NAME}`);
        numRows++
    }

    rs.close();

    if ( numRows === 0 ) {
        throw `no data found for object ID ${p_object_id}`;
    }
    ~';
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    The newly created procedure `result_set_demo_binds` accepts integer values as input. Go ahead and try a few times to see if you can get output on your screen matching an `object_id` in the table.

## Task 3: Calling PL/SQL from JavaScript

The previous lab showed you how to query the database using SQL. In addition to using plain SQL you can make use of the rich PL/SQL API provided by the database. In this example you will use the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO` package to instrument your code.

`DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO` is an important PL/SQL package allowing database developers to associate an application module and action with a session. Should your application ever encounter a performance degradation your operations team can perform a detailed analysis based on the information available in the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) and Active Session History (ASH) provided the DIAGNOSTICS pack is licensed.

This task showcases several additional features:

- IN and OUT (bind-) Variables
- Global variables in an MLE module
- Private functions (`saveModuleAction()` and `setModuleAction()`)
- Custom exception handling

1. Create the JavaScript module

    ```js
    <copy>
    create or replace mle module plsql_demo 
    language javascript as

    // global variable used to preserve the existing module and action
    let savedModuleAction = {};

    // private function - preserve the current values for module and action
    function saveModuleAction() {

        // read the current module and action. Out-variables can be used
        // to retrieve the actual values and store them in the global
        // variable `savedModuleAction`.
        const result = session.execute(`
            begin dbms_application_info.read_module(
                :l_prev_module, 
                :l_prev_action); 
            end;`,
            {
                l_prev_module: {
                    dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT,
                    type: oracledb.STRING
                },
                l_prev_action: {
                    dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT,
                    type: oracledb.STRING
                }
            }
        );

        savedModuleAction.module = result.outBinds.l_prev_module;
        savedModuleAction.action = result.outBinds.l_prev_action;

        console.log(
            `saveModuleAction(): module and action successfully retrieved as:
            - module: ${savedModuleAction.module}
            - action: ${savedModuleAction.action}`
        );
    }

    // private function - restore the previous module and action
    function setModuleAction(module, action) {

        // this call changes the current module and action to the
        // values provided to the function
        session.execute(`
            begin dbms_application_info.set_module(
                module_name => :module,
                action_name => :action);
            end;`,
            [ module, action ]
        );

        console.log(
            `setModuleAction(): module and action successfully updated to:
            - module: ${module}
            - action: ${action}`
        );
    }

    // public function - entry point to the demo
    // to keep the example simple the changes in module
    // and action are printed to the console
    export function moduleActionDemo(object_id) {

        // save the current module and action
        saveModuleAction();

        // set module and action for this task
        setModuleAction('JavaScript PLSQL demo', object_id);

        // execute the "application code"
        const result = session.execute(
            `select
                owner,
                object_name,
                object_id
            from
                result_set_demo_t
            where
                object_id = :object_id`,
            [
                object_id
            ],
            {
                resultSet: true,
                outFormat: oracledb.OUT_FORMAT_OBJECT
            }
        );

        const rs = result.resultSet;
        let numRows = 0;

        for (let row of rs) {
            console.log(`Found a matching record: ${row.OBJECT_ID}    ${row.OWNER}    ${row.OBJECT_NAME}`);
            numRows++
        }

        rs.close();

        // check if any data was returned, throw an exception otherwise
        if ( numRows === 0 ) {
            // make sure module and action are set to their previous values
            // before throwing the exception
            setModuleAction(savedModuleAction.module, saveModuleAction.action);
            throw `no data found for object ID ${p_object_id}`;
        }

        // make sure module and action are set to their previous values
        // before returning from this function
        setModuleAction(savedModuleAction.module, saveModuleAction.action);
    }
    /
    </copy>
    ```

2. Create a call specification for `moduleActionDemo()`

    ```sql
    <copy>
    create or replace procedure moduleActionDemo(p_object_id number)
    as mle module plsql_demo
    signature 'moduleActionDemo(number)';
    /
    </copy>
    ```

3. Execute the call specification

    ```sql
    <copy>
    set serveroutput on
    declare
        l_object_id RESULT_SET_DEMO_T.object_id%type;
    begin
        select 
            min(object_id)
        into
            l_object_id
        from
            RESULT_SET_DEMO_T;
        
        moduleActionDemo(l_object_id);
    end;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    The command should complete successfully, but results will vary because object IDs aren't guaranteed to be assigned in the same way for each database. Here is an example of a successful execution:

    ```
    SQL> declare
      2  l_object_id RESULT_SET_DEMO_T.object_id%type;
      3  begin
      4  select
      5      min(object_id)
      6  into
      7      l_object_id
      8  from
      9      RESULT_SET_DEMO_T;
      10
      11     moduleActionDemo(l_object_id);
      12 end;
      13 /
    saveModuleAction(): module and action successfully retrieved as:
    - module: SQL*Plus
    - action: null
    setModuleAction(): module and action successfully updated to:
    - module: JavaScript PLSQL demo
    - action: 138
    Found a matching record: 138    SYS    ORA$BASE
    setModuleAction(): module and action successfully updated to:
    - module: SQL*Plus
    - action: undefined

    PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
    ```

## Task 4: Perform a DML operation

The previous tasks in this lab focused on _reading_ from the database. In this part of the lab you will perform an insert operation for a change. Rather than providing all columns as part of the insert, you will use a primary key that is defined as an Identity Column.

1. Create a new table for this example

    ```sql
    <copy>
    create table log_t (
        log_id number generated always as identity,
        constraint pk_log_t primary key (log_id),
        log_message varchar2(1024),
        log_time timestamp default systimestamp not null
    );
    </copy>
    ```

2. Create an inline JavaScript function to facilitate the insert statement

    Note the use of an object to provide bind variables (both IN and OUT) to the statement. The out-variable will fetch the auto-generated value for the primary key and return it to the caller.

    ```js
    <copy>
    create or replace function log_me(
        "p_log_message" log_t.log_message%type
    ) return log_t.log_id%type 
    as mle language javascript
    q'~
    const result = session.execute(
        `insert into log_t (
            log_message
        ) values (
            :message
        )
        returning log_id into :id`,
        {
            message: {
                dir: oracledb.BIND_IN,
                val: p_log_message,
                type: oracledb.STRING
            },
            id: {
                dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT,
                type: oracledb.NUMBER
            }
        },
    );

    // by definition the outBinds array can contain only a single
    // element in this scenario. 
    return result.outBinds.id[0];
    ~';
    /
    </copy>
    ```

3. Add an example log message

    ```sql
    <copy>
    declare
        l_id number;
    begin
        l_id := log_me('this is a first test');
        dbms_output.put_line('entry created with ID: ' || l_id);
    end;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

4. View the log message

    Query the log table using the log ID you just obtained

    ```sql
    <copy>
    select
        *
    from
        log_t
    where
        log_id = &id;
    </copy>
    ```

You many now proceed to the next lab.
