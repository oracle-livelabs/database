### **About Oracle Database 23c Free and JSON Duality**

(Filler from Ranjan's blog, this is for him to write)

JSON Relational Duality is a landmark capability in Oracle Database 23c that provides game-changing flexibility and simplicity for Oracle Database developers. This breakthrough innovation overcomes the historical challenges that developers have faced when building applications, either when using the relational model or when using the document model.  

JSON Relational Duality delivers a solution that provides the benefits of both relational tables and JSON documents, without the tradeoffs of either model.
