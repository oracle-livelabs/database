# Introduction

## About the JSON Duality Views Workshop

This workshop focuses on working with JSON Duality Views in Oracle Database 23c.

### **About Oracle Database 23c Free and JSON Duality**

(Filler from Ranjan's blog, this is for him to write)

JSON Relational Duality converges the benefits of the Relational and Document worlds within a single database. Apps can access the same data as a set of JSON documents or as relational tables and columns without data duplication. Whether you are a Relational/SQL developer, Document database developer, Java or Python App developer, gain first-hand experience building apps using Duality Views.

Use your favorite tool, SQL, REST, or Mongo API, to access and update the same data. Build Java and Python apps that use Duality views.

Experience flexibility: Build document-centric apps on relational data or create SQL apps on documents

Experience simplicity: Retrieve and store all the data needed for an app in a single database operation

Define different Duality Views to support multiple use cases

Estimated Time: 30 minutes
