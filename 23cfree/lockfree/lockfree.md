# Lab 3: Lock-Free Reservations

Welcome to the Final Lab: Lock-Free Reservations!

In this lab, we will explore the concept of lock-free reservations and their impact on database transactions. By performing normal updates and utilizing lock-free reservations, we will observe session behavior and the advantages of this feature. Join us as we jump into the final lab and experience the benefits of lock-free reservations in improving performance and user experience. Let's get started!

* By following the steps in this lab, we will gain insights into the behavior of sessions during normal updates and the advantages of lock-free reservations. Join us as we explore these awesome concepts and experience improved performance and user experience with lock-free reservations.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes


### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of database concepts and transactions.
* Familiarity with SQL queries and syntax.
* Access to an Oracle database system.
* User credentials with sufficient privileges to perform updates and create tables.
* Knowledge of session behavior and transaction management.

### Objectives 
* Understand the concept of lock-free reservations and their benefits.
* Perform normal updates and observe session behavior without lock-free reservations.
* Experience session hangs caused by uncommitted changes and insufficient budget amounts.
* Explore the advantages of lock-free reservations in improving performance and user experience.
* Perform updates with lock-free reservations and observe the absence of session hangs.
* Handle session errors caused by going below the "threshold" with lock-free reservations.
* Learn how committing changes and rolling back transactions affect lock-free reservations.
* Recognize the restoration of reserved amounts in the budget column with lock-free reservations.

## Task 1: Normal Update

Task 1 focuses on normal updates. By opening three windows as User 2, we will perform updates on the inventory\_no\_reservations table. In Window 1, we will decrease the budget of a record by 100 but refrain from committing the changes. In Window 2, we will attempt to update the same record by 100, resulting in a session hang due to the uncommitted changes in Window 1. Similarly, in Window 3, we will decrease the record by 200, causing another session hang. We will then commit the changes in Window 1, releasing one of the other two windows. If any freed-up window encounters an error when committing, we will take note of the error message. Note that an insufficient budget amount will cause an abort.

1. Open 3 windows u2, u2, u2

2. In Window 1 update table1(inventory\_no\_reservations) decrease a record by 100 but don’t commit

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_no_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 100 where ID = 1;
    </copy>
    ````


3. Window 2 update t1 and decrease the same record by 100 and it shows that the session hangs. Due to the first update not being commited.

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_no_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 100 where ID = 1
    commit;
    </copy>
    ````

4. Window 3 update t1 and decrease the same record by 200 going below the “threshold”. The session should hang again.

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_no_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 200 WHERE ID = 1
    commit;
    </copy>
    ````

5. In Window 1 please commit the statement below which releases one of the other two windows

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_no_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 100 where ID = 1
    COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ````

6. Once a window is freed up, proceed to the next step without executing any additional instructions.

7. If the freed-up window encounters an error when committing, take note of the error message.

Note: An insufficient budget amount causes an abort.

## Task 2: Lock-Free Reservations

Task 2 introduces the concept of lock-free reservations. Using the same three windows, we will now perform updates on the inventory\_reservations table. In Window 1, we will decrease the budget of a record by 100 without committing. In Window 2, we will update the same record by 100, and unlike before, the session will not hang. In Window 3, we will attempt to decrease the record by 200, going below the "threshold," which will result in a session error. We will then commit the changes in Window 1 and rollback the changes in Window 2. Finally, we will run the transaction again in Window 3, which should succeed because we have restored the reserved amount in the budget column.

Note: Using the same 3 windows

1. Window 1 update t1(inventory\_reservations) decrease a record by 100 but don’t commit

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 100 where ID = 1;
    </copy>
    ````

2. Window 2 update t2 and decrease the same record by 100 and show that the session doesn’t hang.

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 100 where ID = 1
    commit;
    </copy>
    ````

3. Window 3 update t2 and decrease the same record by 200 going below the “threshold” and the session errors

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 200 where ID = 1
    commit;
    </copy>
    ````

4. Commit window 1

    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 100 where ID = 1
    COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ````

5. Roll back window 2
    ````
    <copy>
    ROLLBACK;
    </copy>
    ````


6. Go to Window 3 and run the transaction again and it should succeed because we gave back the 100 to the reserved column, budget
    ````
    <copy>
    UPDATE s1.inventory_reservations
    SET budget = budget - 200 where ID = 1
    COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ````
