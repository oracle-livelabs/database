# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle's Multilingual Engine (MLE), powered by GraalVM, offers a highly performant and enhanced JavaScript engine in Oracle Database 23c on Linux x86-64.

In addition to PL/SQL and Java it is now possible to leverage the Smart DB paradigm with an additional language, JavaScript, opening the database to a huge community of developers. Processing data where they live should offer advantages in performance, scalability, and security. It also allows for a loose coupling between frontend and database, an essential feature for modern application development.

This workshop introduces JavaScript in Oracle Database 23c on Linux x86-64 and walks you through all the steps necessary to be productive with the new language. It complements [Oracle Database JavaScript Developer's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/mlejs/index.html). You will use both command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface when creating code.

> **Note:** There is a strong focus on command line tools for a reason: many software projects rely on automation (keywords Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery). Graphical user interfaces don't work in this workflow, however anything you can control on the command line does. This workshop aims at preparing you for working with Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines as much as possible. Note though that a wealth of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) exists for writing JavaScript code. Database Actions has strong support for JavaScript in Oracle Database 23c Free Release and you will see it used a lot.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hours 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Get started with JavaScript development using a community module in your application
- Create JavaScript modules and environments
- Declare JavaScript functions
- Interact with the database using the JavaScript SQL Driver
- Work effectively with JSON
- Get insights into your code's behaviour using Post Execution Debugging

You may now proceed to the next lab.
