### Objectives
- Initialize the workshop environment.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have requested a Livelabs instance with access details.

## Task 1: Validate that required processes are up and running
1. With access to your remote desktop session, proceed as indicated below to validate your environment before you start running the subsequent labs. The following processes should be up and running:

    - Oracle Sharding GSM1  Container
    - Oracle Sharding GSM2  Container
    - Oracle Sharding Catalog container
    - Three Oracle shard Database containers
    - Appclient Container

2.  Open a terminal session and proceed as indicated below to validate the services.

    - Oracle Sharding container Details

        ```
        <copy>
        sudo docker ps -a
        </copy>
        ```
        ![sharding docker](images/uds19c-init-env-docker-containers-status.png " ")

    - If a container is stopped and not in running state then try to restart it by using the following Docker command.

        ```
        <copy>
        sudo docker stop <container ID/NAME>
        </copy>
        <copy>
        sudo docker start <container ID/NAME>
        </copy>
        ```
    - For multiple containers, run the following commands to restart all of them at once:

        ```
        <copy>
        sudo docker container stop $(sudo docker container list -qa)
        </copy>
        <copy>
        sudo docker container start $(sudo docker container list -qa)
        </copy>
        ```

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
