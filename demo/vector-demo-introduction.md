# Introduction

## About this Demo

Oracle AI Vector Search brings semantic search to Oracle Database 23ai by storing and indexing embeddings directly in the database. This interactive demo showcases how vector embeddings represent meaning, how similarity search retrieves semantically related items, and how these capabilities enable real-world applications like intelligent document search, recommendations, and image similarity.

### Why Use AI Vector Search

Vector search understands meaning, not just keywords. By representing content as high-dimensional vectors, you can retrieve results that are contextually relevant—even when exact words don’t match.

Key benefits:
- Semantic relevance beyond keywords: Find similar items by meaning
- Unified data platform: Combine vectors with relational, JSON, and graph data in Oracle Database 23ai
- Performance at scale: HNSW indexing and efficient distance metrics (cosine, Euclidean, dot product)
- Enterprise-grade: Security, backup/recovery, and manageability you expect from Oracle Database
- Modern AI patterns: Power Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), recommendations, deduplication, and clustering
- Multimodal readiness: Apply vector search to text, images, and more
- Simpler architecture: Keep data and AI search in the same platform to reduce complexity and latency
