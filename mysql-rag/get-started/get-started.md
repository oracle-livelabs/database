# Get Started

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud is the industry's broadest and most integrated cloud provider, with deployment options ranging from the public cloud to your data center. Oracle Cloud offers best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

_Estimated Time:_ 15 minutes

We offer two types of Cloud Accounts:

- _Free Tier Accounts_: After you sign up for the free [Oracle Cloud promotion](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com/?sourceType=:ow:lp:cpo::::RC_WWMK211125P00013:llid=3306) or sign up for a paid account, youâ€™ll get a welcome email. The email provides you with your cloud account details and sign in credentials.

- _Oracle Cloud Paid Accounts_: When your tenancy is provisioned, Oracle sends an email to the default administrator at your company with the sign-in credentials and URL. This administrator can then create a user for each person who needs access to the Oracle Cloud. Check your email or contact your administrator for your credentials and account name.
