## Introduction

This lab will walk you through generating descriptions for all of the images and loading them into the database.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Use two models to generate descriptions for each image
* Load the descriptions and images into a databse

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* All previous labs successfully completed


## Task 1: Open Notebook

This task will have you login to the Jupyter Notebook environment and run the specific notebook for this lab.

1. **If you are already logged into the Jupyter Notebook environment skip to step 5 otherwise** open the "View Login Info" section of your workshop.

6. Follow the steps in the notebook. A few things to remember:
    - There are markdown blocks and code blocks mixed together
    - The run button can be used on both code and markdown blocks (markdown just advances you to the next block)
    - When you run a code block there are [ ] next to the code block. If it changes to a [\*] that means it running. If it has a number like [1] then its done running.
    - Passwords and additional information you may need will be found in the "View Login Info" where the Jupyter Notebook link was

**Note: The notebooks can be downloaded in the learn more section for your viewing**

Once you have completed the steps in the notebook please return to the workshop so you can continue to the next lab.
