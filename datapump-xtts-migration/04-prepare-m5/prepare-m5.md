# Prepare M5 Script

## Introduction

In this lab, you take a first look at the M5 script. For migrations, Oracle recommends that the source and target hosts shared an NFS drive. In this exercise, we simulate that by using the script from the same directory. 

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Examine M5 script
* Configure M5 script

## Task 1: Extract and examine M5 script

In this lab, the source and target database is on the same host. You store the M5 script in the same directory. For a real migration, you should set up a shared NFS drive, so both source and target have access to the same directory. Alternatively, you must copy the directory from source to target after each backup.


## Task 2: Configure M5 script



You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
