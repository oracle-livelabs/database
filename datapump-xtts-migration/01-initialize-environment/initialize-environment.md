# Initialize Environment

## Introduction

In this lab, you will review and start-up all components required to run this workshop successfully.

Estimated Time: 5 Minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Familiarize yourself with the workshop environment
* Initialize the workshop environment

## Task 1: Familiarize yourself with the workshop environment

1. The easiest way to complete the lab is to copy/paste the lab instructions directly into a terminal. Be sure to execute all commands in a code block. After pasting, you must hit *RETURN*.

2. Before copy/pasting, take notice of the commands that you execute; it is important to understand what the commands will do.

3. Double-click on the *Terminal* shortcut on the desktop.

4. The terminal has two tabs, *yellow* and *blue*. *Yellow* ðŸŸ¨ is for the source database. *Blue* ðŸŸ¦ is for the target database.

5. The instructions will tell you which terminal to use.

6. Optionally, in the terminal, you can zoom in to make the text larger.

## Task 2: Initialize the workshop environment

1. When you start the lab, the following components should be started.

    - Database Listener
        - LISTENER
    - Database Server Instances
        - FTEX
        - CDB23

2. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Ensure the listener is started.

    ```
    <copy>
    ps -ef | grep LISTENER | grep -v grep
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ ps -ef | grep LISTENER | grep -v grep
    oracle     11158       1  0 04:57 ?        00:00:00 /u01/app/oracle/product/23/bin/tnslsnr LISTENER -inherit
    ```
    </details>

3. Ensure that the databases (*FTEX* and *CDB23*) are started.

    ```
    <copy>
    ps -ef | grep ora_ | grep pmon | grep -v grep
    </copy>
    ```

    * You might see other databases started as well. It doesn't matter.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ ps -ef | grep ora_ | grep pmon | grep -v grep
    oracle      3851       1  0 20:19 ?        00:00:00 ora_pmon_UPGR
    oracle      5110       1  0 20:19 ?        00:00:00 ora_pmon_FTEX
    oracle      5345       1  0 20:19 ?        00:00:00 ora_pmon_CDB23
    ```
    </details>

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
