# Prepare M5 Script

## Introduction

The next part of the migration is the incremental backups. They built on top of the initial level 0 backup, but backs up only the changes since the last backup. Each incremental backup reduces the time and size of the final incremental backup. Like the previous lab, there is still no downtime yet.

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Complete a backup/restore cycle
* Add data to the source database
* Complete another backup/restore cycle

## Task 1: Perform incremental backup and restore it

1. Set the environment to the source database and start a level 1 backup.

    ```
    <copy>
    . ftex
    cd /home/oracle/m5
    ./dbmig_driver_m5.sh L1
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Notice how *INPUT_BYTES* is very small. This is a consequence of block change tracking. The database knows which blocks were changed since the last backup. On incremental backups, the database just scans the changed blocks.
    * Also, notice how *OUTPUT_BYTES* is very small. You didn't change anything in the database since the last backup, so there are very little changes to back up.
    * The more often you perform incremental backups, the faster they run and the smaller the backup is.
    * In a real migration, you would run incremental backups as often as practicically possible. This limits the amount of changes that goes into the final incremental backup. Only the final incremental backup affects the downtime duration. All other backups are performed before the outage.

    ```
    </details>

2. List the backup scripts. The M5 script has created a new backup script.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd cmd
    ll bkp*cmd
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Notice a new backup script starting with *bkp_L1*. 

    <details>

    ``` text
    $ cd cmd
    $ ll bkp*cmd
    -rw-r--r--. 1 oracle oinstall 641 Jul  2 18:52 bkp_L0_240702185218.cmd
    -rw-r--r--. 1 oracle oinstall 676 Jul  2 19:03 bkp_L1_240702190336.cmd
    ```
    </details>

3. Examine the new backup script. 

    ```
    <copy>
    cat $(ls -tr bkp_L1_*.cmd | tail -1)
    </copy>
    ```

    * The backup is again a regular RMAN `BACKUP ... TABLESPACE` command.
    * However, this time, it is an incremental backup from the SCN of the last backup.

           TABLESPACE USERS;
    }
    ```
    </details>

4. Examine the corresponding restore script. The backup also produced a restore script you can use on the target database.

    ```
    <copy>
    ll restore_L1*cmd
    </copy>
    ```

    ```
    </details>

5. Examine the restore script. 

    ```
    <copy>
    cat $(ls -tr restore_L1_*.cmd | tail -1)
    </copy>
    ```

    * The L1 restore script looks very similar to the L0 script.
    * It also uses the `RESTORE ALL FOREIGN DATAFILES` command.
    * It examines the backup sets and the target database to determine what needs to be done.

    ```
    </details>

6. Restore the backup. 

    ```
    <copy>
    export L1SCRIPT=$(ls -tr restore_L1_* | tail -1) 
    cd /home/oracle/m5
    . cdb23
    rman target "sys/oracle@'localhost/violet'" cmdfile=/home/oracle/m5/cmd/$L1SCRIPT

    15>
    ```
    </details>

7. Search the log file for any warnings or errors. 

    ```
    <copy>
    cd log
    egrep "WARN-|ORA-" $(ls -tr restore*log | tail -1)
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The command produces no output because the search string was not found. This means there were no warnings or errors in the log file.

## Task 2: Make changes in source database

Let's simulate changes to the source database and see how they affect the backup and restore phase.

1. Set the environment to the source database and connect.

    ```
    <copy>
    . ftex
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Create a copy of one of the tables.

    ```
    <copy>
    create table f1.f1_laptimes_backup as select * from f1.f1_laptimes;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> create table f1.f1_laptimes_backup as select * from f1.f1_laptimes;
    
    Table created.
    ```
    </details>

3. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Perform incremental backup / restore

1. Perform the next incremental backup.

    ```
    <copy>
    . ftex
    cd /home/oracle/m5
    ./dbmig_driver_m5.sh L1
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Notice how *INPUT_BYTES* increases from the previous incremental backup. From below 1 MB to around 20 MB. You made changes, so the database needs to scan more blocks. 
    * Also, notice how *OUTPUT_BYTES* increases. From below 1 MB to around 20 MB. You entered new data, so the size of the backup increases.

3. Search the log file for any warnings or errors.

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The command produces no output because the search string was not found. This means there were no warnings or errors in the log file.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.

## Additional information

In a real migration, you would run incremental backup/restore cycles at regular intervals. In the days before the migration, you perhaps do one every day, whereas, on the final day, you run them more often. Ideally, you would complete an incremental backup/restore cycle very close to the start of the downtime window.
