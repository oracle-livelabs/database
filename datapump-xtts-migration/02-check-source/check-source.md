# Check and Prepare Source Database

## Introduction

In this lab, you will perform a number of checks on the source database to ensure it meets the minimum requirements. Also, you will collect information that you use later on to determine if the target database is suitable for the migration.

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Execute a number of checks
* Gather information

## Task 1: Check minimum requirements

The M5 script has a set of minimum requirements.

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨ and set the environment to the source database, *FTEX*.

    ```
    <copy>
    . ftex
    </copy>
    ```

2. Ensure the source database is running on Oracle Database 19c, Release Update 18, or newer. Also, ensure that the Data Pump Bundle Patch is installed.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    OPatch/opatch lspatches
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You find the Release Update installed in the patch named *Database Release Update*.
    * You can idenfity the Data Pump Bundle Patch from the patch name as well.
    * Although this database meets the minimum requirements, Oracle still recommends that you migrate from a source database on the recent-most Release Update.

    ``` text
    $ cd $ORACLE_HOME
    $ OPatch/opatch lspatches
    35648110;OJVM RELEASE UPDATE: 19.21.0.0.231017 (35648110)
    35787077;DATAPUMP BUNDLE PATCH 19.21.0.0.0
    35643107;Database Release Update : 19.21.0.0.231017 (35643107)
    29585399;OCW RELEASE UPDATE 19.3.0.0.0 (29585399)
    
    OPatch succeeded.
    ```
    </details>

3. Connect to the database.

    ```
    <copy>
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>
    ```

4. Ensure that the database is *Enterprise Edition*. Transportable tablespaces is only supported on this edition.

    ```
    <copy>
    select banner from v$version;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select banner from v$version;

    BANNER
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
    ```
    </details>    


## Task 2: Perform checks

To determine whether the target database is fit for the migration, you must gather some information.

1. Get the `compatible` setting of the source database.

    ```
    <copy>
    col value format a20
    select value from v$parameter where name='compatible';
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> col value format a20
    SQL> select value from v$parameter where name='compatible';

    VALUE
    --------------------    
    19.0.0
    ```
    </details>  

2. Get the character set.

    ```
    <copy>
    select value from nls_database_parameters where parameter='NLS_CHARACTERSET';
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select value from nls_database_parameters where parameter='NLS_CHARACTERSET';

    VALUE
    --------------------
    AL32UTF8
    ```
    </details>      

3. Get the database timezone file version.

    ```
    <copy>
    select version from v$timezone_file;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select version from v$timezone_file;

    VERSION
    ----------
    42
    ```
    </details>      

4. Get the database timezone setting.

    ```
    <copy>
    select dbtimezone from v$instance;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select dbtimezone from v$instance;

    DBTIME
    ------
    +00:00
    ```
    </details>

## Task 3: Prepare for migration

Oracle recommends certain changes to the source database. These changes help ensuring a smooth migration.

1. Check the size of the streams pool. Data Pump uses Advanced Queueing which heavily uses the streams pool. To avoid waits while the streams pool is expanded, it is better to expand it upfront. 

    ```
    <copy>
    select value from v$parameter where name='streams_pool_size';
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select value from v$parameter where name='streams_pool_size';
    
    VALUE
    --------------------
    0
    ```
    </details> 

2. It's currently set to *0* which means there is no minimum size for the streams pool. Allocate 128 MB of shared memory to the pool. It can still grow beyond that if needed.

    ```
    <copy>
    alter system set streams_pool_size=128M scope=both;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> alter system set streams_pool_size=128M scope=both;
    
    System altered.
    ```
    </details> 

3. Enable block change tracking. This dramatically reduces the time it takes to perform incremental backups.

    ```
    <copy>
    alter database enable block change tracking;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> alter database enable block change tracking;
    
    Database altered.
    ```
    </details>     

4. Create a directory in the file system that you can use for Data Pump exports.    

    ```
    <copy>
    host mkdir -p /home/oracle/m5/m5dir
    </copy>
    ```

5. Create a directory object that points to the file system directory you just created.

    ```
    <copy>
    create directory m5dir as '/home/oracle/m5/m5dir';
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> create directory m5dir as '/home/oracle/m5/m5dir';
    
    Directory created.
    ```
    </details>

6. Create a dedicated user for the Data Pump jobs and grant the necessary privileges. 

    ```
    <copy>
    create user ftexuser identified by ftexuser default tablespace system;
    grant exp_full_database to ftexuser;
    grant read, write on directory m5dir to ftexuser;
    grant alter tablespace to ftexuser;
    alter user ftexuser quota unlimited on system;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The default user tablespace must be *SYSTEM* or *SYSAUX* because all other tablespaces will be set read-only later on. During export, Data Pump must be able to create a table in the default tablespace.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> create user ftexuser identified by ftexuser default tablespace system;

    User created.

    SQL> grant exp_full_database to ftexuser;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> grant read, write on directory ftexdir to ftexuser;

    Grant succeeded.
    
    SQL> grant alter tablespace to ftexuser;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> alter user ftexuser quota unlimited on system;

    User altered.
    ```
    </details>

7. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```


You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
