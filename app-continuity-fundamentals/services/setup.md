## Task: Install Sample Data

In this step, you will install a selection of the Oracle Database Sample Schemas.  For more information on these schemas, please review the Schema agreement at the end of this lab.

By completing the instructions below the sample schemas **SH**, **OE**, and **HR** will be installed. These schemas are used in Oracle documentation to show SQL language concepts and other database features. The schemas themselves are documented in Oracle Database Sample Schemas [Oracle Database Sample Schemas](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=COMSC).

Copy the following commands into your terminal. These commands download the files needed to run the lab.  (Note: *You should run these scripts as the oracle user*.  Run a *whoami* to ensure the value *oracle* comes back.)

1.  If you aren't already logged in to the Oracle Cloud, open up a web browser and re-login to Oracle Cloud. 

2.  Start Cloudshell
   
    *Note:* You can also use Putty or MAC Cygwin if you chose those formats in the earlier lab.  
    ![](../clusterware/images/start-cloudshell.png " ")

3.  Connect to node 1 as the *opc* user (you identified the IP address of node 1 in the Build DB System lab). 

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/sshkeyname opc@<<Node 1 Public IP Address>>
    ````
    ![](../clusterware/images/racnode1-login.png " ")

4.  Switch to the oracle user
   
    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    </copy>
    ````

    Note: If you are running in Windows using putty, ensure your Session Timeout is set to greater than 0.
5.  Get the seutp files
    ````
    <copy>    
    whoami   
    cd /home/oracle/

    wget https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/setupDB.sh.gz

    gunzip setupDB.sh.gz;

    chmod +x setupDB.sh
    </copy>
    ````
    ![](./images/setup-num5.png " " )

6. The script **setupDB.sh** assumes the password for SYS and SYSTEM user. Edit the script using vi.

    ````
    vi setupDB.sh
    ````
    ![](./images/setup-num6.png " " )

7. Replace the db_pwd with the password you entered when your database was setup.

    ````
    # Pwds may need to be changed
    db_pwd="W3lc0m3#W3lc0m3#"
    ````
     ![](./images/setup-num7.png " " )

8. To save the file press the **esc** key and **wq!** to save the file.
   
9.  No other lines need to be changed.  Run the **setupDB.sh** script

    ````
    <copy>
    /home/oracle/setupDB.sh
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/setup-num7.png " " )

    *Note:* There may be some drop user errors, ignore them.  Please be patient as this script takes some time.

Congratulations! Now you have the data to run subsequent labs.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
