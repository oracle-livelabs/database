      - **Description**:  Same as above
      - **Create in compartment**:  Select the correct compartment if not already selected

     *Note: If this is a newly provisioned tenant such as freetier with no user created compartment, stop here and first create it before proceeding.*

6.  Click **Next**.

  ![](./images/em-create-stack-2x.png " ")

7. Enter or select the following:
    - **Compartment:** Accept the default you entered initially
    - **Select Availability Domain:** Select an availability domain from the dropdown list.
    - **SSH Public Key**:  Paste the public key you created in the earlier lab
    - **DB System Node Shape**: Choose VMStandardE2.4, VMStandard2.4, or VMStandard2.2 (Note that choosing VMStandard2.2 may take some time to create the system)
    - **DB edition**: Enterprise Edition Extreme Performance is required for a RAC database
    - **Database Admin Password**: Database Admin Password must contain two UPPER-case characters, and two special characters (\_, \#) and be 12-30 characters in length (remember this value)
    - **Oracle Database Version**: Choose 19c


    *Note: If you used the Oracle Cloud Shell to create your key, make sure you paste the pub file in a notepad, remove any hard returns.  The file should be one line or you will not be able to login to your compute instance*
8. Depending on the quota you have in your tenancy you can choose from standard Compute shapes or Flex shapes.  We recommend standard shapes unless you have run out of quota (Please visit the Appendix: Troubleshooting Tips for instructions on checking your quota)
    - **Use Flexible Instance Shape with Adjustable OCPU Count?:** Leave unchecked (unless you plan on using a Flex shape)
    - **Instance Shape:** Select VM.Standard.E2.4 (this compute instance requires at least 30 GB of memory to run, make sure to choose accordingly)
  ![](./images/standardshape.png " ")
9. If you choose to use flex shapes, follow the instructions below.  Otherwise skip to the next step.
    - **Instance OCPUS:** Accept the default (**4**) This will provision the ***VM.Standard.E3.Flex*** shape with 4 OCPUs and 64GB of memory.

10. For this section we will provision a new VCN with all the appropriate ingress and egress rules needed to run this workshop.  If you already have a VCN, make sure it has all of the correct ingress and egress rules and skip to the next section.

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Public IP Address>
    ````
    ![](./images/em-cloudshell-ssh.png " ")

3.  When prompted, answer **yes** to continue connecting.
4.  Repeat step 2 for your 2nd node.
5.  You may now *proceed to the next lab*.  


## Task 6: MAC or Windows CYGWIN Emulator
*NOTE:  If you have trouble connecting and are using your work laptop to connect, your corporate VPN may prevent you from logging in. Log out of your VPN before conneting. *
1.  Using one of the Public IP addresses in Step 4, open up a terminal (MAC) or cygwin emulator as the opc user.  Enter yes when prompted.

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Public IP Address - node1>
    ````
    ![](./images/em-mac-linux-ssh-login.png " ")

2. You can also log in to the **Public IP Address of node2**

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Public IP Address - node2>
    ````
    ![](./images/em-mac-linux-ssh-login.png " ")

3. After successfully logging in, you may *proceed to the next lab*

## Task 7: Windows using Putty
*NOTE:  If you have trouble connecting and are using your work laptop to connect, your corporate VPN may prevent you from logging in. Log out of your VPN before conneting. *

On Windows, you can use PuTTY as an SSH client. PuTTY enables Windows users to connect to remote systems over the internet using SSH and Telnet. SSH is supported in PuTTY, provides for a secure shell, and encrypts information before it's transferred.

1.  Download and install PuTTY. [http://www.putty.org](http://www.putty.org)
2.  Run the PuTTY program. On your computer, go to **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**
3.  Select or enter the following information:
    - Category: _Session_
    - IP address: _Your service instance’s (node1) public IP address_
    - Port: _22_
    - Connection type: _SSH_

  ![](images/7c9e4d803ae849daa227b6684705964c.jpg " ")

### **Configuring Automatic Login**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Connection and then **Select** Data.

2.  Enter your auto-login username. Enter **opc**.

  ![](images/36164be0029033be6d65f883bbf31713.jpg " ")

### **Adding Your Private Key**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Auth.
2.  **Click** browse and find the private key file that matches your VM’s public key. This private key should have a .ppk extension for PuTTy to work.

  ![](images/df56bc989ad85f9bfad17ddb6ed6038e.jpg " ")

3.  To save all your settings, in the category section, **Click** session.
4.  In the saved sessions section, name your session, for example ( EM13C-ABC ) and **Click** Save.

### **Repeat Putty setup for the second node**

1. Repeat the steps upbove to create a login window for the second node - use the Public IP address of node2
3.  Select or enter the following information:
    - Category: _Session_
    - IP address: _Your service instance’s (node2) public IP address_
    - Port: _22_
    - Connection type: _SSH_

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.  

## Appendix:  Teraform and Resource Manager
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.  Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.  In this lab a configuration file has been created for you to build network and compute components.  The compute component you will build creates an image out of Oracle's Cloud Marketplace.  This image is running Oracle Linux 7.

Resource Manager is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. To learn more about OCI Resource Manager, take a watch the video below.
