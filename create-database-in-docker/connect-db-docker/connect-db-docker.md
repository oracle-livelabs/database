# Connect to an Oracle Database in a Docker Container

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to connect to an Oracle Database running in a Docker container on an Oracle Cloud Compute instance. You can connect the Oracle Database instance using any client you wish. In this lab, you will connect using Oracle SQL Developer.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud paid account or free trial. To sign up for a trial account with $300 in credits for 30 days, click [here](http://oracle.com/cloud/free).
* SSH keys
* A Docker container running Oracle Database 19c
* An open port (1521) on your Oracle Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
* [Oracle SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html)

## Task 1: Create a connection through SQL Developer

1. If you do not have Oracle SQL Developer installed in your computer, first download it using the above link and install it on your computer.

2. Launch Oracle SQL Developer and select **New Connection** (the green + sign).

3. In the New / Select Database Connection window, enter the following information:
     * In the **Name** field, enter **DockerDB** as the name of this connection.
     * In the **Username** field, enter **sys**.
     * In the **Password** field, enter the password (`LetsDocker`) for the SYS account.
     * Select **SYSDBA** from the **Role** drop down list.
     * Check the **Save Password** checkbox.
     * In the **Hostname** field, enter your Oracle Compute instance Public IP address.
     * Click **Service name** and enter **ORCLPDB1**.

4. Click **Test** to check your connection. You will see a Success message in the **Status** field.

  *Note: If you see `The Network Adapter could not establish the connection` error, you may want to check if the Source CIDR of Ingress Rule was entered correctly in the previous lab.*  

5. Click **Save** to save your connection details and then click **Connect**.
