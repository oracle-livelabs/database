# Introduction

## About this Workshop

With the growing Kubernetes adoption, customers, engineers and DevOps teams have sought ways to manage their cloud resources through automation tools like Kubernetes allowing us to include these resources in development lifecycles and CI/CD pipelines.

The Oracle DB operator for Kubernetes allows users (DBAs, Developers, DevOps, GitOps teams, etc.) **to manage database lifecycles and dynamically do database operations such provision, clone, and more through Kubernetes**. With the Oracle DB operator for Kubernetes makes the Oracle Database more accessible through Kubernetes allowing users to focus more on their applications and less on the infrastructure. It also eliminates the dependency on a human operator or administrator for such operations. This lab showcases workflows we can simplify with the Oracle DB Operator for Kubernetes, or OraOperator with different databases.

This workshop will provide the users the knowledge in installing, using and deploying with the OraOperator. In the following labs, the users will integrate with Oracle DevOps and provision test environments leveraging liquibase and an OraOperator-provisioned database.

Estimated Workshop Time: 115 minutes

### About Product/Technology
<!-- 
Helidon microservices with Javascript fr
ont-end will be deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kubernetes cluster (OKE) which will access and Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database. -->

Jenkins is hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize build automation and scale the deployment by using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry and Container Engine for Kubernetes. GitHub is being used for source code management.

### Objectives

<!-- * Learn how to automate the continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery and deployment (CD) pipelines for your application development using Jenkins.
* Learn how to host it on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize build automation and scale the deployment by using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry and Container Engine for Kubernetes.
* Learn how Oracle Database addresses the change management challenges with its tools like SQLcl and Liquibase for managing database change tracking. -->

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported.

## Upcoming Versions
* Leveraging PATCH in a pipeline
* Adding Observability
 

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
