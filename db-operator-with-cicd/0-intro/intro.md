# Introduction

## About this Workshop

With the growing Kubernetes adoption, customers, engineers and DevOps teams have sought ways to manage their cloud resources through automation tools like Kubernetes allowing us to include these resources in development lifecycles and CI/CD pipelines.

The Oracle DB operator for Kubernetes allows users (DBAs, Developers, DevOps, GitOps teams, etc.) **to manage database lifecycles and dynamically do database operations such provision, clone, and more directly through Kubernetes**. The Oracle DB operator for Kubernetes makes the Oracle Database more accessible through Kubernetes allowing users to focus more on their applications and less on the infrastructure. It also eliminates the dependency on a human operator or administrator for such operations. This lab showcases one example of what you can do with the Oracle DB Operator for Kubernetes (OraOperator) in relation to DevOps.

This workshop will provide the users the knowledge in installing, using and deploying an Autonomous Database (ADB) with the OraOperator. In the following labs, the users will integrate with Jenkins and provision environments which will consist of an OraOperator-provisioned Single-Instance database (SIDB) whenever they create a branch.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### About Product/Technology

Spring-Boot microservices with a React front-end will be deployed on an Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster which will access the OraOperator-provisioned Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database.

Jenkins is hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize build automation. GitHub is used to manage the lab source code which you will need to fork to make changes.

### Objectives

* Learn how to install and use the Oracle DB Operator for Kubernetes
* Learn how to provision an Autonomous Transaction Processing Database with the Operator
* Learn how the OraOperator can provision Single-Instance Databases upon creation of branches on GitHub

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported.

## Upcoming Versions
