# Teardown

## Introduction

In this lab, we will tear down the resources created in your tenancy and the directory in the Oracle cloud shell.

Estimates Time: 10 minutes

Quick walk through to tear down the resources created in your tenancy and the directory in cloud shell.

### Objectives

## Task 1: Run teardown

To begin teardown, run the following command below. The teardown script will delete the cloud resources generated by Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) and the Oracle DB Operator for Kubernetes. The teardown script will also run terraform destroy to terminate the rest of the lab-related resources.
    ```bash
    <copy>
    (cd $CB_STATE_DIR ; ./teardown.sh)
    </copy>
    ```
## Task 2: Delete the workshop directory
When done with the lab, you can delete the workshop directory and the application repository on __Cloud Shell__

```bash
    rm -r cbworkshop && rm -r oracle.cloud.native.devops-oraoperator
```
