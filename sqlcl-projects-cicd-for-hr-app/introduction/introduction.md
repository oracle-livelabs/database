# Introduction

## About this Workshop

As a developer at Tech Solutions Company, you’ve been tasked with adding new features to the HR application. As the company grows, so do the challenges of managing both the application and its database.

Many developers appreciate the benefits of CI/CD pipelines for automating application deployments, yet database CI/CD integration is often overlooked. Manually handling database updates, rollbacks, and migrations can lead to significant errors and delays. What if managing database changes could be as seamless as deploying application code?

Meet the **SQLcl Projects CI/CD workflow** a powerful tool designed to revolutionize database development. Oracle SQLcl brings automation, consistency, and reliability to database management, empowering developers like you to handle changes efficiently and overcome common obstacles.
