# Build a Marketing Analytics Application Powered by MySQL HeatWave

## Introduction

HeatWave is a fully managed database service that lets developers quickly
develop and deploy secure cloud-native applications using the worldâ€™s most
popular open source database. MySQL HeatWave is the only MySQL service
with a massively-scalable, integrated, real-time query accelerator, and a fully
automated in-database machine learning engine. This service overcomes the
limitations of traditional data warehouse, analytics and machine learning
environments that use periodic long-running ETL batch jobs to refresh the
data. MySQL HeatWave provides a unified MySQL database platform for
OLTP, OLAP and machine learning.


In this workshop, you will first learn to deploy and configure MySQL HeatWave, including its built-in in memory query accelerator. You will then develop an analytics application allowing retail customers to obtain, visualize, and redeem discount coupons based on their previous purchases. You will build this application using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack with step-by-step instructions and sample code, and experience the high performance of MySQL HeatWave to run complex analytics queries.

Overall this workshop will show you how easy it is to create and manage MySQL HeatWave and how MySQL HeatWave enables you to make informed business-critical decisions with real-time insights.
