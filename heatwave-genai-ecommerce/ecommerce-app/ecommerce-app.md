# Build an E-Commerce Application with HeatWave GenAI

## Introduction

You can create new applications by using HeatWave with LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) or any other software stack.

In this lab, you will build a LAMP stack and deploy a prebuilt HeatWave e-commerce application. The in-database LLMs of HeatWave GenAI automatically analyze the sentiment of user-submitted reviews and summarize and translate review summaries into other languages. 

### Objectives

In this lab, you will be guided through the following tasks:

- Connect to the HeatWave instance.
- Set up stored procedures for sentiment analysis.
- Install Apache App Server.
- Install PHP.
- Create HeatWave/PHP connect test app.
- Deploy HeatWave e-commerce application.
- Test HeatWave e-commerce application.

### Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 2.

_Note:_ This application code is intended for educational purposes only. It is designed to help developers learn and practice application development skills with HeatWave on OCI. The code is not designed to be used in a production environment.

_Estimated Time:_ 20 minutes

## Task 1: Connect to the HeatWave Instance

If you are a Linux, Mac, or Windows 10 Powershell user, skip the first step.

1. If you are a Windows user, click the **Start** menu from your windows machine and search **Git Bash**. Select **Git Bash**, which will take you to the Git Bash terminal.

2. From a terminal window on your local system, connect to the compute instance.

    ```bash
    <copy>ssh -i  <PathtoSSHFile> opc@<ComputeIPAddress></copy>
    ```
    Replace the following:

    - PathtoSSHFile: The path where you stored the SSH file in Lab 2, Task 1, Step 10.
    - ComputeIPAddress: The compute IP address that you created in Lab 2, Task 1, Step 13.

    For example: 

    ```bash
    <copy>ssh -i  C:/Users/MyUser/.ssh/ssh-key-2024.key opc@129.198.x.192</copy>
    ```

    ![SSH command](./images/compute-ssh.png "SSH command")

3. Install MySQL Shell on the compute instance.

    ```bash
    <copy>sudo yum install mysql-shell</copy>
    ```

    ![Install MySQL Shell](./images/install-mysql-shell.png "Install MySQL Shell")

4. After MySQL Shell is installed, connect to the endpoint of the DB system.

    ```bash
    <copy>mysqlsh <DBAdminName>@<DBSystemEndpointIPAddress> </copy>
    ```

    Replace the following:
    
    - DBAdminName: The admin name of the DB system that you created in  Lab 1, Task 5, Step 5.
    - DBSystemEndpointIPAddress: The DB system private IP address that you noted in Lab 1, Task 5, Step 19.

    For example:

    ```bash
    <copy>mysqlsh admin@10.0.x.100</copy>
    ```

    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>use ecommerce;</copy>
    ```

    ![Create database](./images/create-schema.png "Create database")

2. Create a stored procedure for sentiment analysis.

    ```bash
    <copy> delimiter // </copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>CREATE PROCEDURE SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_TEXT(
    IN review TEXT,
    OUT processed_sentiment VARCHAR(20)
    ) LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT AS $$
    let prompt = `Classify the review into NEGATIVE or POSITIVE \n${review}.
    Please provide a single word to describe the sentiment: "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE". \nSentiment:`;
    let sentiment = ml.generate(prompt);
    processed_sentiment = sentiment.toUpperCase().search("POSITIVE") != -1 ? "POSITIVE" : "NEGATIVE";
    $$; //
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Create procedure](./images/sp-sentiment-analysis.png "Create procedure")

3. Create a stored procedure to summarize and translate reviews.

    ```bash
    <copy>CREATE PROCEDURE SUMMARISE_TRANSLATE_TEXT(
          IN all_reviews TEXT,
          IN language VARCHAR(20),
          OUT processed_summary TEXT
        ) LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT AS $$
          let summary = ml.generate(all_reviews, {task: "summarization"});
          processed_summary = summary.trim();
           if (language != "english") {  
            let prompt = `Translate the Original Text to ${language}. \n 
                                   - Original Text: "${processed_summary}"\n - ${language} Translation:`;
            let translation = ml.generate(prompt); 
            processed_summary = translation.split('\n')[0];
          }
          $$; //
        </copy>
    ```

    ![Updated ecommerce interace](./images/updated-ecommerce.png "Updated ecommerce interace")

9. Click ctrl+O, followed by **Enter** to save the file.

10. Click ctrl+X to exit the editor.

## Task 7: Test HeatWave E-Commerce Application

1. From your web browser, access the ecommerce.php file. 

    ```bash
    <copy>http://<ComputePublicIPAddress>/genai_ecommerce_app/ecommerce.php</copy>
    ```

    For example:
    
    http://129.153.xx.143/genai_ecommerce_app/ecommerce.php

2. You'll see a ecommerce page  with a text input field where you can enter reviews. The application will send your review to HeatWave GenAI and analyze the sentiment.

    ![Input field](./images/input-field.png "Input field")

3. Enter your review into the input field and click **Analyze Sentiment**. 

    For example:

    ```bash
    <copy>I highly recommend this T-Shirt. The softness of the cotton material and the comfortable fit make it perfect for everyday wear. The washing instructions are clear and easy to follow, ensuring that the T-Shirt retains its quality. </copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>The T-Shirt is made from high-quality cotton and is perfect for casual outings. However, the lack of bleach instructions may be a concern for some customers. Overall, I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars. </copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>This T-Shirt is not up to the mark. The material is not durable enough and the washing instructions are not clear. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a long-lasting and easy-to-care-for T-Shirt. </copy>
    ```

    ![Enter your reviews](./images/analyze-sentiment.png "Enter your reviews")

4. HeatWave GenAI analyzes your review and tells you whether the review was positive or negative review.

    ![Sentiment analysis](./images/sentiment-analysis.png "Sentiment analysis")

5. If you want to generate a summary of all reviews in any other language, enter the reviews in the input field, select your preferred langauge from the drop down list, and click **Summarize & Translate**.

    ```bash
    <copy>Very happy with them. They are not very durable. just a little bit on the large side, and I’m normally a large, sometimes XL. They have "bobbled" after only 2 washes. Bought this product thinking they look very similar to big brand version, but in reality they are not. The fabric (i don’t know what it is?) is not like that you’d expect, it feels strange and isn’t comfortable in gym in terms of making me feel hot and sweaty instead of wicking away that feeling. Don’t recommend, wouldn’t buy again. Are you kidding they are enormous, bought medium for tighter fit but are like a tent! Not figure hugging at all not even close. Straight up n down.</copy>
    ```

    ![Summarize & Translate](./images/summarize-translate.png "Summarize & Translate")

6. HeatWave GenAI summarizes and translates your review in your preferred language.

    ![Summarize & Translate output](./images/spanish-output.png "Summarize & Translate output")
