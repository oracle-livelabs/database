## About Oracle Database 23ai

Oracle Database 23ai is the current long term support release version of the database. This means that it is the suggested version for all enterprise workloads by Oracle Corporation. Oracle Database 23ai is the newest release, combining all the features developed over the past 40 years, similar to the previous long-term support release, version 19c, and the innovation release, version 21c. 

The Oracle Database is what is called a 'converged' database. This means the database supports multiple different data types like Relational, JSON, XML, Graph, Vector, and more. Converged also means it has the ability to run all sorts of workloads, from Transactional to IoT to Analytical to Machine Learning and more. It also can also handle a number of different development paradigm, including Microservices, Events, REST, SaaS, and CI/CD, (to name a few). All of this functionality can be used right 'out of the box'. All while still benefiting from Oracles leading performance, security, scalability and availability.

Oracle Database was built on 3 key themes. 
* AI for Data
* Dev for Data
* Mission Critical for Data


### **AI for Data**
AI for Data brings in a new era for the Oracle Database. The goal of AI in the database is to help developers add AI functionality to all their applications in the easiest way possible, as well as adding GenAI capabilities to all of our products to help improve the productivity of developers, DBAs, and data analysts. AI Vector Search is part of Oracle Database 23ai and is available at no additional cost in Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition 2, Database Free, and all Oracle Database Cloud services.


### **Dev for Data**
Dev for Data in Oracle Database 23ai makes it easier than ever to develop using the Oracle Database. Oracle now offers multiple free versions of the database (built on the same code as the paid version) like Oracle Database Free, Oracle Free Autonomous Database on the cloud, and Oracle Free Autonomous Database on-premises. In addition, new features like JSON-Relational Duality Views allow you to build your applications using BOTH relational and JSON in the same app. Property Graphs allow you to build and model relations (like those found in the real world) in a new and simple way through the database's built-in support for property graph views and the ability to query them using the new SQL/PGQ standard, plus tons more features.


### **Mission Critical for Data**
Oracle Database focuses on providing the highest availability for companies and some of the [world's most important systems](https://www.oracle.com/docs/tech/database/con8821-nyse.pdf). From functionality like Oracle Real Applications Clusters to Oracle Active DataGuard and much, much more, the Oracle Database allows you to safeguard your critical systems against unforeseen downtime.


If you are currently using Oracle Database 19c or 21c, you can directly upgrade to Oracle Database 23ai. All prior versions should upgrade to 19c first, then 23ai.

Check out this lab for free access to two databases and a hands-on guide to get some experience with upgrading from different versions and architectures like non-PDB to PDB:
