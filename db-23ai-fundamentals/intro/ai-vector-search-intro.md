# Introduction

Welcome to the "AI Vector Search Quick Start" workshop. In this workshop, you will learn what vectors are and how they are used in AI applications. We will cover the creation of vector tables, perform basic DDL operations, and dive into similarity search using some of the new SQL functions in Oracle Database 23ai. This lab is meant to be a small introduction to the new AI functionality that Oracle Database 23ai supports.

This lab will focus on AI Vector search at a very high level. If you're looking for an in depth workshop on AI Vector Search, check out the following labs:
