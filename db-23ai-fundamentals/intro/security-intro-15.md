# Introduction

In this workshop, we introduce you to a newly released feature of Oracle Database 23ai--_Schema-Level Privileges_. Previously, developers had to either give users full-access to the database or manually grant user privileges to each database object in a schema. With Oracle Database 23ai, developers can now grant privileges at the schema-level--making it easier to secure your database.

## About Oracle Database 23ai

Building on the strengths of its predecessor, Oracle Database 23ai represents the latest long-term support release, delivering new cutting-edge technology. Just like Oracle Database 19c, version 23ai provides best-in-class support for all data types, including the new Vector data type along with relational, JSON, XML, spatial, graph, and more, coupled with industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and security for various workloads.

Users of Oracle Database 19c and 21c can directly upgrade to Oracle Database 23ai.
