# Introduction

Welcome to the Oracle Database Security workshop for Oracle Database 23ai! In this workshop, we will explore some of the new security features introduced in Oracle Database 23ai, focusing on Security Firewall, Schema Level Privileges, and the Developer Role. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how these features can help improve the security of your database environment. This section will be updated over time.

## About Oracle Database 23ai

Building on the strengths of its predecessor, Oracle Database 23ai represents the latest long-term support release, delivering new cutting-edge technology. Just like Oracle Database 19c, version 23ai provides best-in-class support for all data types, including the new Vector data type along with relational, JSON, XML, spatial, graph, and more, coupled with industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and security for various workloads.

Users of Oracle Database 19c and 21c can directly upgrade to Oracle Database 23ai.

### **New Security Features**

This section explores some of the new Security features in Oracle Database 23ai.
* **SQL Firewall:** 
    - SQL Firewall offers real-time protection against common database attacks by monitoring and blocking unauthorized SQL and SQL injection attacks from inside the database. 

- **Schema Level Privileges:**
    - Prior to Oracle Database 23ai, managing schema privileges required more administration efforts. With schema-level privileges, administrators can easily reduce the overhead involved in granting and managing privileges, and improve security at the same time.

- **Developer Role:**
    - The Developer Role provides a comprehensive set of system privileges, object privileges, predefined roles, PL/SQL package privileges, and tracing privileges required by application developers.

    
You may now proceed to the next section.
