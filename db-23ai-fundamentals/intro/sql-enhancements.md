# Introduction

Welcome to the SQL Enhancements focus area of the workshop! This section is dedicated to exploring the latest advancements in SQL within Oracle Database 23ai. SQL, as a cornerstone of database management, has profoundly shaped the software industry, offering a standardized and intuitive language for interacting with data across various database types.

Oracle Database has been committed to prioritizing SQL functionality, and striving to elevate its capabilities. With over four decades of innovation, Oracle has consistently pushed the boundaries of what SQL can achieve.

In Oracle Database 23ai, significant enhancements have been made to the SQL layer, further solidifying its position as a leading database solution.

This section will be updated over time. If you'd like to see a specific feature added, tag me on X (twitter) with your suggestion! [@Killianlynchh](https://twitter.com/Killianlynchh)

## About Oracle Database 23ai SQL Enhancements

This section explores some of the new SQL features in Oracle Database 23ai.


## SQL Enhancements in Oracle Database 23ai

In Oracle Database 23ai, several key enhancements have been introduced to the SQL layer, giving developers new functionality to enhance productivity and efficiency. Some of these enhancements include:
  
- **Boolean Data Type:** The introduction of a new boolean data type enhances data modeling capabilities, allowing for more efficient representation and manipulation of boolean values.

- **IF EXISTS:** The IF EXISTS statements are powerful tools for executing SQL commands based on the existence or non-existence of certain conditions or objects inside the database.

- **Table Value Constructors:** Table value constructors provide a convenient way to specify multiple rows in insert, select, or merge statements, simplifying data manipulation tasks.

- **Direct Joins in Updates:** Streamlined syntax for performing direct joins in update operations simplifies query construction and improves code readability.
  
- **DML RETURNING Clause Enhancements:** The `RETURNING INTO` clause for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` statements has been enhanced to report old and new values affected by the respective statement. This allows developers to use a uniform approach for each of these DML types to obtain values before and after statement execution, enhancing efficiency and reducing the database workload.
