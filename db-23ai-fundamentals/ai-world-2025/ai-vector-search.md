# Lab: Oracle AI Vector Search for Healthcare Documents

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Oracle AI Vector Search** lab! In this hands-on session, you'll explore Oracle Database  23ai's powerful AI Vector Search capabilities using the LumenCare healthcare scenario.

Building on the patient data from our previous labs, you'll learn how to create vector embeddings from healthcare documents stored in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage and perform semantic searches to find relevant medical information.

Estimated Lab Time: 25 minutes

### What You'll Learn

- Loading ONNX Embedding Models into the database
- Creating vector tables with Oracle  23ai's AI Vector Search
- Generating embeddings for semantic similarity searches
- Performing vector searches on documents
- Connecting vector search results to existing patient data
- How to load text documents from OCI Object Storage using Pre-Authenticated Request (PAR) URLs

### Prerequisites

- Access to Oracle Database  23ai
- Completion of previous LumenCare labs (recommended)
- Basic SQL knowledge


## Task 1: Load the Embedding Model for Vector Search
1. In order to create embeddings and perform vector searches, you'll need an embedding model. Oracle Database allows you to optionally load embedding models into the database to perform secure embedding. In this task, you'll load the **ALL\_MiniLM_L12\_v2** model that has been staged in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage. This model will be used to create our vectors.

2. Vector search enables semantic similarity matching by converting unstructured objects into high-dimensional numerical vectors called embeddings. Similar content produces similar vectors, allowing the database to find related information based on meaning rather than exact text matches.

    The ALL\_MiniLM\_L12\_v2 model is a lightweight transformer model optimized for generating high-quality sentence embeddings that work perfectly with Oracle's native vector search capabilities.

3. **Create and execute the embedding model loader script**. The following PL/SQL block will:

    - Download the pre-trained ONNX model from Oracle's Object Storage
    - Load it into your database as `ALL_MINILM_L12_V2`
    - Make it available for generating embeddings in subsequent tasks

    **Expected Result:** You should see output confirming the model was successfully loaded with the name `ALL_MINILM_L12_V2`. This model will be used throughout the remaining tasks to generate vector embeddings for our healthcare documents.

    **Note:** This one-time setup process enables Oracle Database to generate embeddings locally without requiring external API calls.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    DECLARE 
        ONNX_MOD_FILE VARCHAR2(100) := 'all_MiniLM_L12_v2.onnx';
        MODNAME VARCHAR2(500);
        LOCATION_URI VARCHAR2(200) := 'https://adwc4pm.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/eLddQappgBJ7jNi6Guz9m9LOtYe2u8LWY19GfgU8flFK4N9YgP4kTlrE9Px3pE12/n/adwc4pm/b/OML-Resources/o/';

    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('ONNX model file name in Object Storage is: '||ONNX_MOD_FILE); 

        SELECT UPPER(REGEXP_SUBSTR(ONNX_MOD_FILE, '[^.]+')) INTO MODNAME  ;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Model will be loaded and saved with name: '||MODNAME);

        BEGIN DBMS_DATA_MINING.DROP_MODEL(model_name => MODNAME); EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;

        DBMS_CLOUD.GET_OBJECT(                            
            credential_name => NULL,
            directory_name => 'DATA_PUMP_DIR',
            object_uri => LOCATION_URI || ONNX_MOD_FILE);

        DBMS_VECTOR.LOAD_ONNX_MODEL(
            directory => 'DATA_PUMP_DIR',
            file_name => ONNX_MOD_FILE,
            model_name => MODNAME);

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('New model successfully loaded with name: '||MODNAME);
    END;
    </copy>
    ```

2. Now Check ONNX Runtime availability
    ```sql
    <copy>
    SELECT model_name, mining_function
    FROM user_mining_models
    WHERE model_name = 'ALL_MINILM_L12_V2';
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Set Up Vector Search Infrastructure

1. Before we can perform vector searches, we need to configure the necessary database components. Oracle  23ai provides built-in AI vector capabilities that integrate seamlessly with existing data.

    ```sql
    <copy>

        -- First, let's create our vector search schema objects
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS healthcare_documents (
            doc_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
            title VARCHAR2(200),
            content CLOB,
            document_type VARCHAR2(50),
            created_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE,
            CONSTRAINT pk_healthcare_docs PRIMARY KEY (doc_id)
        );

        -- Add vector column for embeddings
        ALTER TABLE healthcare_documents ADD (
            content_vector VECTOR(384, FLOAT32)
        );

    </copy>
    ```
    **Note** I am only using an alter statement here to draw attention to the vector datatype. You can also simply add this while creating the table.



## Task 3: Load Healthcare Documents from Object Storage
1. Now, load Healthcare Documents from Object Storage using DBMS_CLOUD with PAR URLs

    ```sql
    <copy>
        DECLARE
            l_blob       BLOB;
            l_content    CLOB;
            l_title      VARCHAR2(500);
            l_first_line VARCHAR2(1000);
            l_doc_count  PLS_INTEGER := 0;

            TYPE url_array IS VARRAY(100) OF VARCHAR2(2000);
            l_file_urls url_array := url_array(
                    'https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/VmOEXelaGdlmUe8hv6fsgEBKrWKx7nFoDSsVB71BdLoU_DfrLc6skHreAXet1ce4/n/oradbclouducm/b/aiworld-demo/o/archived_messages_courtney.txt',

                );
                -- add more URLs here
            BEGIN
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Loading healthcare documents from Object Storage...');

            FOR i IN 1 .. l_file_urls.COUNT LOOP
                -- 1) fetch bytes into memory (function form)
                l_blob := DBMS_CLOUD.GET_OBJECT(
                        credential_name => NULL,          -- ok for a pre-authenticated URL
                        object_uri      => l_file_urls(i)
                        );

                -- 2) convert to text (explicit UTF-8 decode; safer than CAST_TO_VARCHAR2)
                l_content := UTL_I18N.RAW_TO_CHAR(l_blob, 'AL32UTF8');

                -- 3) derive a title from the first line
                l_first_line := REGEXP_SUBSTR(l_content, '^[^' || CHR(10) || CHR(13) || ']*');
                l_title := TRIM(l_first_line);

                -- 4) insert WITHOUT embedding for now
                INSERT INTO healthcare_documents (title, content, document_type, content_vector)
                VALUES (l_title, l_content, 'Healthcare Document', NULL);

                l_doc_count := l_doc_count + 1;
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('✓ Loaded: ' || l_title);
            END LOOP;

            COMMIT;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Successfully loaded ' || l_doc_count || ' documents.');
            END;
            /
    </copy>
    ```
2. Now, verify the loaded documents
    ```sql
    <copy>

        SELECT doc_id,
                title,
                document_type,
                LENGTH(content) as content_length,
                SUBSTR(content, 1, 150) || '...' as content_preview
        FROM healthcare_documents
        ORDER BY doc_id;

    </copy>
    ```



## Task 4: Generate Vector Embeddings

1. Oracle  23ai can generate embeddings using built-in AI capabilities. We'll create vector representations of our healthcare documents that capture their semantic meaning.

    ```
    <copy>
        UPDATE healthcare_documents
        SET content_vector = VECTOR_EMBEDDING(ALL_MINILM_L12_V2 USING content AS DATA)
        WHERE content IS NOT NULL;
        COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ```
    What’s going on here?
    Think of a vector as a point in space. In two dimensions, that might be an (x, y) coordinate on a graph. But embeddings are 384 dimensions — far too big to draw — so we use math to measure closeness.
    * When we say “similarity,” we really mean distance.
    * If two documents are “close” in vector space, they’re semantically similar.
    * Oracle gives us the function VECTOR_DISTANCE to calculate that closeness.

    Smaller distance = more similar.
2. Look at one of the vectors 

    ```
    <copy>
        SELECT doc_id,
            title,
            content_vector
    FROM healthcare_documents
    FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 5: Perform Basic Vector Similarity Searches

1. Now let's perform semantic searches to find similar healthcare documents. Vector search finds content with similar meaning, even if the exact words differ.

    Let’s try something practical. We’ll embed a short English phrase, turn it into a query vector, then order our documents by cosine distance to that query. Suppose a clinician wants to quickly find all records related to blood pressure management.
    ```
    <copy>
    -- Search for documents similar to a diabetes query
    WITH search_query AS (
        SELECT VECTOR_EMBEDDING(
            ALL_MINILM_L12_V2 USING 'diabetes management and blood sugar control' AS DATA
        ) as query_vector
         
    )
    SELECT hd.doc_id, 
        hd.title,
        hd.document_type,
        ROUND(VECTOR_DISTANCE(hd.content_vector, sq.query_vector, COSINE), 4) as similarity_score,
        SUBSTR(hd.content, 1, 100) || '...' as content_preview
    FROM healthcare_documents hd, search_query sq
    ORDER BY VECTOR_DISTANCE(hd.content_vector, sq.query_vector, COSINE) ASC
    FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
    </copy>
    ```
    What you’ll see near the top:
    * Leslie’s secure messages discussing Lisinopril and DASH diet
    * The nutrition consultation notes about reducing sodium
    * Her lipid panel with cholesterol results

    One short phrase pulls together patient communications, labs, and diet counseling — no keywords needed.

3. Now let’s look for Courtney’s recovery notes.
    ```
    <copy>
    WITH q AS (
    SELECT VECTOR_EMBEDDING(ALL_MINILM_L12_V2 USING
            'meniscus repair discharge instructions and physical therapy progression' AS DATA) AS v
     
    )
    SELECT d.doc_id,
        d.title,
        SUBSTR(d.content, 1, 180) || '...' AS snippet,
        VECTOR_DISTANCE(d.content_vector, q.v, COSINE) AS distance
    FROM healthcare_documents d
    CROSS JOIN q
    ORDER BY distance
    FETCH FIRST 4 ROWS ONLY;
    </copy>
    ```
    Expected results:
    * Courtney’s clinical notes 
    * Physical therapy session notes showing progress
    * Operative report and discharge summary after arthroscopic repair
    * Even the MRI authorization request appears, because it’s part of the same clinical episode

4. Let's try one more. 

    ```
    <copy>
    WITH q AS (
    SELECT VECTOR_EMBEDDING(ALL_MINILM_L12_V2 USING
            'overpronation running gait analysis foot x-ray findings' AS DATA) AS v
     
    )
    SELECT d.doc_id,
        d.title,
        SUBSTR(d.content, 1, 180) || '...' AS snippet,
        VECTOR_DISTANCE(d.content_vector, q.v, COSINE) AS distance
    FROM healthcare_documents d
    CROSS JOIN q
    ORDER BY distance
    FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
    </copy>
    ```

    Likely matches:
    * Radiology foot X-ray showing flatfoot/overpronation
    * Sports medicine consult with cadence and form recommendations
    * Patient messages about training goals and soreness

    This gives a complete view of the gait assessment — imaging, specialist report, and the patient’s own words.


## Task 6: Creating Vector Indexes

1. Now we'll learn about Oracle Database  23ai's vector indexing capabilities. Vector indexes are essential for scaling vector search operations as your document corpus grows, providing significant performance improvements for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searches.

  Oracle  23ai provides two main types of vector indexes optimized for different use cases:
    - **In-Memory Neighbor Graph Vector Index**: Uses Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs for fast searches
    - **Neighbor Partition Vector Index**: Uses Inverted File Flat (IVF) approach for balanced performance

  In Autonomous Database, the vector memory size is automatically managed, making vector index creation and management much simpler than in traditional Oracle databases.

2. Vector indexes provide several benefits: Speed, Scalability, Accuracy,  Control. Lets create a vector index - In-Memory Neighbor Graph Vector Index 

    ```sql
    <copy>
    -- Create In-Memory Neighbor Graph Vector Index
    -- This type is optimized for fast, accurate searches
    CREATE VECTOR INDEX idx_healthcare_content_inmemory
    ON healthcare_documents(content_vector)
    ORGANIZATION INMEMORY NEIGHBOR GRAPH
    DISTANCE COSINE
    WITH TARGET ACCURACY 95;
    </copy>
    ```

    **What this does:**
    - `INMEMORY NEIGHBOR GRAPH`: Uses HNSW algorithm for fast searches
    - `DISTANCE COSINE`: Matches our search queries (always align with your search metric)
    - `TARGET ACCURACY 95`: Aims for 95% accuracy vs exact brute-force search

2. We can check the status of the vector index in the user indexes table just as expected
    ```sql
    <copy>
    -- Check index status
    SELECT index_name, index_type, status, 
           ityp_owner, ityp_name
    FROM user_indexes 
    WHERE index_name = 'IDX_HEALTHCARE_CONTENT_INMEMORY';
    </copy>
    ```

3. **Alternative: Create a Neighbor Partition Vector Index** (for comparison):

    ```sql
    <copy>
    -- First drop the previous index
    DROP INDEX idx_healthcare_content_inmemory;

    -- Create Neighbor Partition Vector Index
    -- This type balances speed with memory usage
    CREATE VECTOR INDEX idx_healthcare_content_partition  
    ON healthcare_documents(content_vector)
    ORGANIZATION NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS
    DISTANCE COSINE
    WITH TARGET ACCURACY 95;
    </copy>
    ```

    **Key differences:**
    - **NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS**: Uses IVF (Inverted File Flat) approach
    - Better for larger datasets with memory constraints
    - Slightly different performance characteristics


3. **Important index management best practices:**

    - **Keep distance metrics consistent**: Always use the same distance metric (COSINE, EUCLIDEAN, etc.) in both index creation and queries
    - **Monitor accuracy vs performance**: Higher TARGET_ACCURACY values provide better results but use more resources  
    - **Regular statistics**: Keep table statistics current for optimal query plans
    - **Autonomous advantages**: In Autonomous Database, vector memory is auto-managed, eliminating manual tuning
