# Introduction

Welcome to the "Database Tools" section of this workshop. In the following two labs, you will learn about two different tools that you can use to access the Oracle Database. We will cover both Database Actions (AKA SQL Developer Web) and the new SQL Developer VS Code Extension. These two labs will focus on what they are and how to set them up. 

### **SQL Developer Web**
SQL Developer Web provides a browser-based interface to manage your Oracle Database without requiring additional installations. It supports running queries, managing database objects, and visualizing data models directly through Oracle Database Actions. It’s a straightforward tool designed for quick access and efficient database management.

### **SQL Developer on VS Code
For those who live in VS Code, the SQL Developer extension integrates Oracle Database management directly into your favorite editor. It combines the elegance of Oracle’s SQL tools with the flexibility of a lightweight coding environment. Writing and running queries, exploring database objects, or debugging PL/SQL—all without leaving the editor—makes this extension a dream for developers who want everything in one place. Plus, with almost 200k installs (since I last checked) it’s as simple to set up as it is to use.
