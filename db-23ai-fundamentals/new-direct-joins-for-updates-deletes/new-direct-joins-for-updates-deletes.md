# Simplifying Data Manipulation in SQL with Direct Joins

## Introduction

Welcome to Simplifying Data Manipulation in SQL! In this lab, you'll learn about the new 23ai feature called direct joins in SQL. Direct joins allow you to easily update and delete data across multiple related tables. 

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objective:
The goal of this lab is to help you understand and use direct joins effectively in SQL. By the end of this lab, you'll be able to confidently update and delete data across tables, making your database management tasks much easier.

### Prerequisites:
- Access to Oracle Database 23ai.
- Basic understanding of SQL is helpful.

## Task 1: Working with direct joins

1. From the Autonomous Database home page, **click** Database action and then **click** SQL.
    ![click SQL](images/im1.png " ")
   
2. Lets imagine you've built the next movie streaming app, but for some reason, no one wants to watch the thriller movies. You decide to create a small test by artificially improving the rating of thriller movies to see if that coax people into watching them. 

    Your task? To boost the ratings of Thriller movies that fall below a certain threshold, so that your users always have a 'top-tier' thriller recommendation.


    ```
    <copy>
    DROP TABLE if exists GENRES CASCADE CONSTRAINT;
    DROP TABLE if exists MOVIES CASCADE CONSTRAINT;
    
    -- Create GENRES table
    CREATE TABLE GENRES (
        GENRE_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        GENRE_NAME VARCHAR(50)
    );

    -- Create MOVIES table
    CREATE TABLE MOVIES (
        MOVIE_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        TITLE VARCHAR(100),
        GENRE_ID INT,
        RATING DECIMAL(3,1),
        FOREIGN KEY (GENRE_ID) REFERENCES GENRES(GENRE_ID)
    );

    -- Insert sample data into GENRES table
    INSERT INTO GENRES (GENRE_ID, GENRE_NAME) VALUES
    (1, 'Thriller'),
    (2, 'Horror'),
    (3, 'Comedy'),
    (4, 'Drama');

    -- Insert sample data into MOVIES table
    INSERT INTO MOVIES (MOVIE_ID, TITLE, GENRE_ID, RATING) VALUES
    (1, 'The Silence of the Lambs', 1, 8.6),
    (2, 'Psycho', 2, 8.5),
    (3, 'Airplane!', 3, 7.7),
    (4, 'The Shawshank Redemption', 4, 9.3),
    (5, 'Seven', 1, 8.6),
    (6, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 2, 7.5),
    (7, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', 3, 8.2),
    (8, 'The Godfather', 4, 9.2);
    </copy>
    ```
    ![create the tables for the workshop](images/movies-1.png " ")

3. First we'll take a look at all of our thriller movies and their ratings 

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT m.movie_id, m.title, m.genre_id, m.rating
    FROM movies m
    JOIN genres g ON m.genre_id = g.genre_id
    WHERE g.genre_name = 'Thriller';
    </copy>
    ```
    ![show the thriller movies](images/movies-2.png " ")

4. In older versions of Oracle, you'd have to resort to creating sub-queries to execute the updates. This could make SQL more complex and difficult to maintain.

    In Oracle Database 23ai the syntax is much simpler and the join can be performed in the same update statement.

    ```
    <copy>
    UPDATE movies m
    SET m.rating = m.rating + 0.5
    FROM genres g
    WHERE m.genre_id = g.genre_id
    AND g.genre_name = 'Thriller';
    </copy>
    ```
    ![show the thriller movies](images/movies-3.png " ")

5. Wait, what if we don't like horror movies? Let's say we decide to purge all of our Horror genre.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT m.movie_id, m.title, m.genre_id, m.rating
    FROM movies m
    JOIN genres g ON m.genre_id = g.genre_id
    WHERE g.genre_name = 'Horror';
    </copy>
    ```
    ![remove the thrillers](images/movies-4.png " ")


6. Again, with Oracle 23ai's direct join capability, removing these movies becomes a lot easier.

    ```
    <copy>
    DELETE FROM movies m
    FROM genres g
    WHERE m.genre_id = g.genre_id
    AND g.genre_name = 'Horror';
    </copy>
    ```
    ![delete movies](images/movies-5.png " ")

6. In this Lab, you learned how direct joins simplify data manipulation tasks, especially in updating and deleting data across multiple related tables. By using direct joins, you've learned how to make your SQL queries more efficient, readable, and easier to maintain. Feel free to continue practicing or choose a new lab to try out!

8. We can clean up from the lab by dropping our tables.

    ```
    <copy>
    DROP TABLE if exists GENRES CASCADE CONSTRAINT;
    DROP TABLE if exists MOVIES CASCADE CONSTRAINT;
    </copy>
    ```
