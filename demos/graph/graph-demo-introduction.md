# Introduction

## About this Demo

Oracle Operational Property Graphs in Oracle Database 23ai let you model entities and relationships as vertices and edges with rich key–value properties. This interactive demo shows how graph structures enable intuitive traversal, expressive pattern matching (SQL/PGQ), and in-database analytics for real-time applications such as fraud detection, recommendations, network analysis, and knowledge graphs.

What you’ll see:
- Introduction: Basics of property graph modeling
- Model: Vertices, edges, and properties
- Query: Pattern matching with SQL/PGQ and traversals
- Analytics: Examples of graph measures (e.g., shortest path, centrality)
- Use Cases: Fraud rings, recommendations, supply chain, knowledge graphs
- Code: Example snippets and links to documentation

### Why Use Operational Property Graphs

Operational property graphs bring graph insights to your mission-critical applications directly in the operational database.

Key benefits:
- Real-time insights: Query and analyze connected data without moving it out of the database
- Unified data model: Combine graph with relational and JSON in Oracle Database 23ai
- Expressive querying: Use SQL/PGQ for standards-based graph pattern matching alongside SQL
- In-database analytics: Run graph algorithms close to your data for lower latency and better security
- Enterprise-grade: ACID transactions, security, backup/recovery, and manageability
- Simplified architecture: Avoid ETL to external graph stores; reduce complexity and data drift
