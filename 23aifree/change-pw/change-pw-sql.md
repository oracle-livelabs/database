## Introduction

Resetting the password for the hol23c user in the Oracle Database.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Open SQL Plus
* Set the password for the hol23c user

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Oracle Database 23ai Free Developer Release
* A terminal or console access to the database

## Task 1: Setting database user password

1. The first step is to get to a command prompt. If you need to open a terminal and you are running in a Sandbox environment click on Activities and then Terminal.

2. Next set your environment. The oraenv command will set all of the environment variables based on your database. When prompted type FREE for the database name or if you supplied a different database name use that.
    ```
    [FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
     ORACLE_SID = [FREE] ? FREE
     The Oracle base has been set to /opt/oracle OR The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /opt/oracle.
    [FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$
		```

3. Next connect to your database.
    ```
		[FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>

4. Next change to your pluggable database. If your pluggable database is a different name, make sure to change the command below.
    ```
    SQL> <copy>alter session set container = freepdb1;</copy>

    Session altered.

5. To change the password for the user hol23c use the "alter user \[username\] identified by \[new password\]" command. The syntax below for the hol23c user, make sure to replace new\_password\_here to your new password. Throughout this workshop we will use the Welcome123 password.
    ```
		alter user hol23c identified by [new_password_here];
		```
    ```
    SQL> <copy>alter user hol23c identified by Welcome123;</copy>

    User altered.

    SQL>
    ```
    ![Change password](images/change-password1.png " ")

6. Once the password has been changed you can exit SQL Plus as sysdba.

    ```
		SQL> <copy>exit</copy>
