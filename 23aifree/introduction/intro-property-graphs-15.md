# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This workshop focuses on working with Property Graphs in Oracle AI Database. You will create a graph from two tables, one containing bank account information, and another containing bank transactions information.  You will then run graph pattern queries in SQL on this graph.   You will find circular payment chains, multi-hop paths between accounts, and more.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About Product/Technology - Property Graphs on 26ai

In Oracle AI Database the GRAPH_TABLE function and MATCH clause of the SQL:2023 standard enable you to write simple SQL queries to follow connections in data.  This workshop illustrates how you can model your data as a graph and run graph queries in SQL to quickly see relationships in your data that are difficult to identify otherwise.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a PROPERTY GRAPH from relational tables
* Run graph pattern queries in SQL, using the syntax from the SQL:2023 standard

### Prerequisites

* Knowledge of SQL
