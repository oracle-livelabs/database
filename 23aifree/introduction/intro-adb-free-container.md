# Introduction

## About This Workshop

In this workshop, you'll quickly set up the Oracle Autonomous Database Free Container Image 23ai in our virtual remote desktop environment. You'll start the container and execute a few scripts to make APEX and ORDS available, ensuring a seamless integration. Utilizing Podman Compose, you'll achieve a consistent configuration, and gain access to adb-cli, ORDS, APEX, Database Actions, and more through an automated setup process. This approach allows you to easily harness the full potential of the Oracle  Autonomous Database Free 23ai.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About Product/Technology - Oracle Autonomous Database Free Container Image 23ai
Oracle Autonomous Database provides an easy-to-use, fully autonomous database that scales elastically and delivers fast query performance. As a service, Autonomous Database does not require database administration. Autonomous Database provides a fully managed Oracle Database that is available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

The Oracle Autonomous Database Free Container Image provides an alternative to run Autonomous Database in a container in your own environment, without requiring access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console or to the internet. When you run Autonomous Database in a container, the container provides a local, isolated environment with additional options for development, testing, and exploration of Oracle Autonomous Database features.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Login to the container registry
* Pull and run the container image
* Start up adb-cli, ORDS, and APEX
