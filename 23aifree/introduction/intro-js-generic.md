# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle's Multilingual Engine (MLE), powered by GraalVM, offers a highly performant and enhanced JavaScript engine in Oracle AI Database 26ai on Linux x86-64 and aarch64.

In addition to PL/SQL and Java it is now possible to leverage the Smart DB paradigm with an additional language, JavaScript, opening the database to a vibrant community of developers. Processing data where they live should offer advantages in performance, scalability, and security. It also allows for a loose coupling between frontend and database, an essential feature for modern application development.

This workshop introduces JavaScript in Oracle AI Database 26ai on Linux and walks you through all the steps necessary to be productive with the new language. It complements [Oracle AI Database JavaScript Developer's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/mlejs/index.html). The workshop is centered around the use of Autonomous Database. You can run the example in your own (free) tenancy or create a sandbox environment for the duration of the workshop.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hours 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Get started with JavaScript development using a community module in your application
