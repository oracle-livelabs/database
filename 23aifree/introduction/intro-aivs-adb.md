# Introduction

## About the Workshop

With Oracle Autonomous Database Free, you get to explore the newest features of Oracle Database 23ai at no-cost! In this workshop, we'll show you how to get started by installing the ADB Free 23ai container image, which requires no access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console or the internet.

After installation, you'll learn how to further extend the capabilities of the Autonomous Database by exploring Oracle REST Data Services. You'll be using SQL Developer Web to experience how Oracle AI Vector Search can take your data to the next level. 

### **About the Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai Free Container Image**
Oracle Autonomous Database provides an easy-to-use, fully autonomous database that scales elastically and delivers fast query performance. As a service, Autonomous Database does not require database administration. Autonomous Database provides a fully managed Oracle Database that is available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

The Oracle Autonomous Database Free Container Image provides an alternative to run Autonomous Database in a container in your own environment, without requiring access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console or to the internet. When you run Autonomous Database in a container, the container provides a local, isolated environment with additional options for development, testing, and exploration of Oracle Autonomous Database features.
