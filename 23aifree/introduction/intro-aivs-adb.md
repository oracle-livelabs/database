# Introduction

## About the Workshop

With Oracle Autonomous Database Free, you get to explore the newest features of Oracle Database 23ai at no-cost! This workshop guides you through the container image installation to get started in your own environment, without requiring access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console or to the internet.

After installation, you'll learn how to further extend the capabilities of the Autonomous Database by installing ORDS, APEX, and SQLcl. Once your environment is set for development, you'll (introduce the vector search activity) and see just how easy it is to leverage AI Vector Search. 

### **Oracle Database 23ai Free**


 

### **Tools - SQLcl**

Oracle SQL Developer Command Line (SQLcl) is a modern, free command line interface for Oracle Database. It allows you to interactively or batch execute SQL and PL/SQL. SQLcl provides in-line editing, statement completion, and command recall for a feature-rich experience, all while also supporting your previously written SQL*Plus scripts.

### **Tools - Database Actions**
Formerly known as SQL Developer Web, Database Actions brings you your favorite Oracle Database desktop tool’s features and experience to your browser! Delivered as a single-page web application, Database Actions is powered by Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS). Database Actions offers, a worksheet for running queries and scripts, the ability to manage and browse your data dictionary, a REST development environment for your REST APIs and AUTOREST enabled objects, an interface for Oracle’s JSON Document Store (SODA), a DBA console for managing the database, a data model reporting solution, and access to PerfHub.

### **Tools - APEX**
Oracle APEX is the world's most popular enterprise low-code application platform that enables you to build scalable, secure web and mobile apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere – cloud or on premises. Using APEX, developers can quickly develop and deploy compelling apps that solve real problems and provide immediate value. You don't need to be an expert in a vast array of technologies to deliver sophisticated solutions. Focus on solving the problem and let APEX take care of the rest.
