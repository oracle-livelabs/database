# Change the user password and start ORDS

## Introduction

Resetting the password for the hol23c user in the Oracle Database and starting up ORDS, which will be needed to start up other applications.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Set the password for the hol23c user

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Oracle Database 23ai Free Developer Release
* A terminal or console access to the database

## Task 1: Setting database user password and starting ORDS

1. The first step is to get to a command prompt. If you need to open a terminal and you are running in a Sandbox environment click on Activities and then Terminal.

    ![Open a new terminal](images/open-terminal.png " ")

2. Next set your environment. The oraenv command will set all of the environment variables based on your database. When prompted type FREE for the database name or if you supplied a different database name use that.
    ```
    [FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
    ```
    ```
     ORACLE_SID = [FREE] ? <copy>FREE</copy>
     The Oracle base has been set to /opt/oracle OR The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /opt/oracle.
    [FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$
		```

    <!-- ![Set environment](images/set-envt-free1.png " ") -->


3. Next connect to your database.
    ```
		[FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>

    SQL*Plus: Release 23.0.0.0.0 - Developer-Release on Wed Apr 5 13:38:14 2023
    Version 23.2.0.0.0

    Copyright (c) 1982, 2023, Oracle.  All rights reserved.

    Connected to:
    Oracle Database 23ai Free, Release 23.0.0.0.0 - Developer-Release
    Version 23.2.0.0.0

    SQL>
		```
    ![Connect to the database](images/connect-db-sysdba1.png " ")

4. Next change to your pluggable database. If your pluggable database is a different name, make sure to change the command below.
    ```
    SQL> <copy>alter session set container = freepdb1;</copy>

    Session altered.

    SQL>
		```
    ![Change to PDB](images/alter-session1.png " ")

5. To change the password for the user hol23c use the "alter user \[username\] identified by \[new password\]" command. The syntax below for the hol23c user, make sure to replace new\_password\_here to your new password. Throughout this workshop we will use the Welcome123 password.
    ```
		<copy>alter user hol23c identified by </copy>[new_password_here];
		```
    ```
    SQL> alter user hol23c identified by Welcome123;

    User altered.

    SQL>
    ```
    ![Change password](images/change-password1.png " ")

6. Once the password has been changed you can exit SQL Plus.

    ```
		SQL> <copy>exit</copy>
Disconnected from Oracle Database 23ai Free, Release 23.0.0.0.0 - Developer-Release
Version 23.2.0.0.0
[FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$
		```

    ![Exit](images/exit1.png " ")

7. To start ORDS, from the same command prompt use the following command. The output of [1] 204454 is just an example, your output could be different.

    ```
		[FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$ <copy>ords serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &</copy>
[1] 204454
[FREE:oracle@hol23cfdr:~]$
		```

    **NOTE:** You must leave this terminal open and the process running. Closing either will stop ORDS from running, and you will not be able to access other applications that are used in this lab.

    ![Start ORDS](images/ords1.png " ")

## Task 2: Connecting to your database user

1. Your browser should still be open, if not just open a new one. If running in a Sandbox go to Activities and then at the top click on new window. If Chrome is not running then click on Chrome.

    ![New Chrome window navigation](images/new_chrome_window.png " ")

2. The address for SQL Developer Web on your machine is below. Copy and paste that into the browser.
    >Note: If you did not start ORDs, ORDs stopped working or you closed that terminal, go back and complete the steps in Lab 2 to start ORDs. It must be running to log in here.

    ```
    <copy>
    http://localhost:8080/ords/hol23c/_sdw
    </copy>
    ```
    ![ORDS url entered into the browser](images/ords_url.png "ORDs url")

3. To login use the username hol23c with the password you set into the browser.

    ![Logging into ORDS with hol23 credentials](images/ords_login.png "ORDs login")

4. To be able to run SQL statements you will need in the sql worksheet. Click on **SQL**.

5. You are now logged in and should be at a screen that looks like this.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
