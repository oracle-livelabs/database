## Task 1: Concise Task Description

(optional) Task 1 opening paragraph.

1. Step 1

	![Image alt text](images/sample1.png)

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use the following formats. _The filename must be in lowercase letters and CANNOT include any spaces._

	Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

	When the file type is recognized by the browser, it will attempt to render it. So you can use the following format to force the download dialog box.

	Download the [sample JSON code](files/sample.json?download=1).

  > Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin, or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)

2. Step 2

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
