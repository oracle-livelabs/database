# What is data mesh?

A hot topic in enterprise software, data mesh is a new approach to thinking about data based on a distributed architecture for data management. The idea is to make data more accessible and available to business users by directly connecting data owners, data producers, and data consumers. Data mesh aims to improve business outcomes of data-centric solutions as well as drive adoption of modern data architectures.


## A new concept for data
A data mesh approach is a paradigm shift to thinking about data as a product. Data mesh introduces organizational and process changes that companies will need to manage data as a tangible capital asset of the business. Oracle’s perspective for the data mesh architecture calls for alignment across organizational and analytic data domains.

A data mesh aims to link data producers directly to business users and, to the greatest degree possible, remove the IT middleman from the projects and processes that ingest, prepare, and transform data resources.

Oracle’s focus on data mesh has been in providing a platform for our customers that can address these emerging technology requirements. This includes tools for data products; decentralized, event-driven architectures; and streaming patterns for data in motion. For data product domain modeling and other sociotechnical concerns, Oracle aligns with the work being done by the thought leader in data mesh, Zhamak Dehghani.

### Benefits of a Data Mesh

Investing in a data mesh can yield impressive benefits, including:
* Total clarity into data’s value through applied data product thinking best practices.
* More than 99.999% operational data availability (PDF) using microservices-based data pipelines for data consolidation and data migrations.
* 10X faster innovation cycles, shifting away from manual, batch-oriented ETL to continuous transformation and loading (CTL).
* More than 70% reduction in data engineering, gains in CI/CD, no-code and self-serve data pipeline tooling, and agile development
