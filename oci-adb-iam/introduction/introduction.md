# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Managing users on a database-by-database basis is cumbersome, especially when working with a large number of databases. It can lead to mistakes where database user accounts exist long after the user has left the organization. Additionally, users within organizations change teams or are promoted but often never have their privileges from their previous role revoked. This causes them to end up overprivileged for their current responsibilities. Integrating database users with Oracle Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a quick and easy way to simplify user management across OCI managed databases such as the Autonomous Database, ExaCS, Base DBS and ExaCC.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Provision an Autonomous Database
* Set IAM as the identity provider of your ADB
* Grant IAM users access to your ADB
* Access and interact with your ADB using IAM database password
* Access and interact with your ADB using a token

### Prerequisites

In order to do this workshop, you need

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account

### Note

Some screenshots and videos may be different than what you see. These screenshots and videos were with a tenancy with IAM and not using IAM with Identity Domains. However, the functionality remains the same. Only use the default (root) domain when working with IAM with Identity Domains.
