# Latency Test

## Introduction

In Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless, it is a common requirement for end customers and internal operations to quickly determine the latency while connecting to a particular service.

A typical use case for such a test would be when a customer query or a workload is running with an unusually high latency and the user needs to ensure if the database service used by the workload, is healthy and is not having inherent latency issues impacting the workload / queries.

*adbping* is an easy to use command line tool that can easily help end users determine the connection and SQL execution latency to benchmark the performance outside of their business workload.

Tool is feature rich, allowing users to run the benchmark test with multitude of options including multi client support, multi threaded, configurable connection characteristics like pool size and other options.

Estimated Time: 20 Minutes

## Task 2: Generate ADBPing report for ADB

ADBPing can evaluate multiple connection methods, like Java or SQL*Plus. It connects and execute a simple query (`select 1 from dual`) as many times it can for a period. Based on timings on the executions, it generates a report.

1. Execute *adbping* for *SAPPHIRE* ADB and check the SQL*Plus method.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    . adb

    cd ~/adbping/

    ./adbping -u admin -p Welcome_1234 -w $TNS_ADMIN -c sqlplus -s sapphire_tp -d 10 -t 10
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The tool runs the test for 10 seconds (*-d 10*).
    * It opens 10 threads in parallel (*-t 10*).

    ```

    </details>

    * In 10 seconds, 670 times the session was opened and *select 1 from dual* was executed.
    * The time to execute each SQL was avg 0.478 ms. This is less than 1 ms, which is very fast.
    * The time to connect and execute was about 127 ms.
    * The connection time accounted almost 100% of the total time.

2. Execute the same check, now using the Java method.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ./adbping -u admin -p Welcome_1234 -w $TNS_ADMIN -c java -s sapphire_tp -d 10 -t 10
    </copy>
    ```

    * *-c java* tells the tool to use a Java connection instead.

    ```

    </details>

    * Java connects once and create a connection pool, that saves all the time it takes for the authentication handshake process.
    * In 10 seconds, 123896 times the session was opened and *select 1 from dual* was executed. This is almost 200x more than using SQL*Plus method.
    * The time to execute each SQL was avg 0.826 ms, less than 1 ms, which is still very fast.
    * The time to connect and execute was about 0.858 ms.
    * The connection time accounted less than 1% of the total time now.
    * Reason for all this gain is because Java will connect once and use a pool to run the statements.

## Task 3: Compare result with current PDBs

Even though ADBPing was a tool created to check latency for ADB, it can also be used to connect in any oracle database, including the local ones.

In this lab, we will run it against the *BLUE* PDB and compare the results with the previously gathered for *SAPPHIRE*.

1. Execute *adbping* for *BLUE* PDB, via SQL*Plus method.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ./adbping -u system -p oracle -w $TNS_ADMIN -c sqlplus -s //localhost:1521/blue -d 10 -t 2
    </copy>
    ```

    * Checking how many times in 10 seconds (*-d 10*) we can execute a simple SQL (*select 1 from dual*).
    * Connecting to ADB using "sqlplus".
    * Opening 2 threads (*-t 2*) in parallel.
    * We only 2 parallel process or we may cause starvation on the local connection resources.

    ```

    </details>

    * In 10 seconds, 380 times the session was opened and *select 1 from dual* was executed.
    * The time to execute each SQL was avg 0.368 ms.
    * This was about the same time it took in ADB.
    * The time to connect and execute was about 49 ms.
    * The connection time accounted almost 100% of the total time.
    * It took 2.5x more time to stablish SQL*Plus connection on *SAPPHIRE* ADB than on the local *BLUE* PDB.

2. Execute *adbping* for *BLUE* PDB, via Java method. This time on the local PDB.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ./adbping -u system -p oracle -w $TNS_ADMIN -c java -s //localhost:1521/blue -d 10 -t 10
    </copy>
    ```

    * This command is similar to the previous one. However, this time we connect using Java method.

    ```

    </details>

    * In 10 seconds, 555099 times the session was opened and *select 1 from dual* was executed.
    * This is about 1500x faster than using SQL*Plus method.
    * This is 3x more than using java method on ADB.
    * The time to execute each SQL was avg 0.145 ms.
    * The time to connect and execute was about 0.162 ms.
    * The connection time accounted less than 1% of the total time.

3. After mesuring and comparing the total latency for ADB vs the local PDB, we can see PDB is faster, specially as the authentication process does not use TLS or mTLS. However, both runs so fast that the difference is only spotted at the sub-milisecond layer.

4. As this difference will not represent any problem to our application, we can move forward with this migration. In case the latency passes any threshold defined by the application team, it would be needed to move the application closer to ADB, before moving forward with the process.

You may now [*proceed to the next lab*](#next).
