# Check Sapphire Migration

## Introduction

In this lab, we will perform the same post-migration tasks we did for *RUBY*, but now on to determine whether the *SAPHIRE* import was successful.

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Examine errors and log files
* Compare schemas

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

* You have completed Lab 6: Migrate with Data Pump over NFS

## Task 1: Verify Data Pump errors

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Examine the last lines of a Data Pump import log file.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    tail -1 /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs.log
    </copy>
    ```

    * The last line for *schemas\_import\_nfs.log* says *completed with 1 error*.
    * You need to examine the entire log file if you want to find the details.

    ``` text
    $ tail -1 /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs.log
    02-JUL-25 13:43:11.295: Job "ADMIN"."SYS_IMPORT_SCHEMA_01" completed with 1 error(s) at Wed Jul 2 13:43:11 2025 elapsed 0 00:00:46
    ```

    </details>

2. In the Data Pump NFS import, we experience an error. What is it about it?

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    grep -B 1 -A 2 'ORA-' /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs.log
    </copy>
    ```

    * We are getting all lines containing 'ORA-', plus the 1 line before (-B) and 2 lines after (-A) it.
    * Notice there was a *insufficient privileges* error when trying to create a DB Link.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    02-JUL-25 13:42:30.736: W-1 Processing object type SCHEMA_EXPORT/DB_LINK
    02-JUL-25 13:42:30.809: ORA-31685: Object type DB_LINK:"SH"."F1" failed due to insufficient privileges. Failing sql is:
    CREATE DATABASE LINK "F1"  CONNECT TO "F1" IDENTIFIED BY VALUES ':1'  USING '//localhost:1521/red'
    02-JUL-25 13:42:30.819: W-1      Completed 1 DB_LINK objects in 0 seconds
    ```

    </details>

3. These are just examples of the errors you might encounter. In each situation, you must investigate the situation and determine whether or not it influences the integrity of the data you're moving.

## Task 2: Comparing total rows on Data Pump export/import logs

1. You can also compare total rows returned in both import/export logs. This is a good way for tracking overall missing objects and errors.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    grep -w exported /nfs_mount/schemas_export.log | grep -w rows | awk '{print $7,$10}' | sort > /nfs_mount/schemas_export_rows.log

    grep -w imported /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs.log | grep -w rows | awk '{print $7,$10}' | sort > /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs_rows.log

    head /nfs_mount/schemas_export_rows.log

    diff -s /nfs_mount/schemas_export_rows.log /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs_rows.log
    </copy>
    ```

    * The commands extract the number of rows exported and imported from the Data Pump log files and store them in separate files.
    * It then prints one of the files - then one with the number of exported rows.
    * Then it uses *diff* to find differences in the files. If the number of rows exported and imported for a given table didn't match, there would be a difference in the files.
    * This is not the case here, so the same amount of rows were exported and imported.
    * This does, however, not say if the content of the rows are actually the same.

    ``` text
    $ grep -w exported /nfs_mount/schemas_export.log | grep -w rows | awk '{print $7,$10}' | sort > /nfs_mount/schemas_export_rows.log
    $ grep -w imported /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs.log | grep -w rows | awk '{print $7,$10}' | sort > /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs_rows.log
    $ head /nfs_mount/schemas_export_rows.log
    "HR"."COUNTRIES" 25
    "HR"."DEPARTMENTS" 27
    "HR"."EMPLOYEES" 107
    "HR"."JOB_HISTORY" 10
    "HR"."JOBS" 19
    "HR"."LOCATIONS" 23
    "HR"."REGIONS" 4
    "IX"."AQ$_ORDERS_QUEUETABLE_G" 0
    "IX"."AQ$_ORDERS_QUEUETABLE_H" 0
    "IX"."AQ$_ORDERS_QUEUETABLE_I" 0
    $ diff -s /nfs_mount/schemas_export_rows.log /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs_rows.log
    Files /nfs_mount/schemas_export_rows.log and /nfs_mount/schemas_import_nfs_rows.log are identical
    ```

    </details>

## Task 3: Revisiting the CPAT checks

When we executed CPAT for the *BLUE* database, there were some items on the "Review Required" action that we had for the target database:

1. Database Links.

    ![Database Links](./images/blue-dblinks.png)

2. External Tables.

    ![External Tables](./images/blue-external-tables.png)

3. Directories.

    ![Directories](./images/blue-directories.png)

    So it's not a surprise that some issues will need to be fixed after the migration. On the next tasks, we will check and fix them.

    This is also again a good opportunity to read the CPAT file for any other finding, including the "Review Suggested" ones.

## Task 4: Fix the database link error

In ADB Serverless, the syntax to create a database link is different. We must use *DBMS\_CLOUD\_ADMIN* instead for the *CREATE DATABASE LINK* command.

First, this DB Link was connecting from (*BLUE* -> *RED*). As both databases were migrated, now this needs to be changed to connect from (*SAPPHIRE* -> *RUBY*). Also, we need to upload the *RED* wallet to ADB directory.

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Let's first connect on ADB:

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    . adb
    sql admin/Welcome_1234@sapphire_tp
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Create a directory to keep the wallet files.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    create directory ruby_dblink_wallet_dir as 'ruby_dblink_wallet_dir';

    grant execute on dbms_cloud to SH;

    grant execute on dbms_cloud_admin to SH;

    grant read on directory ruby_dblink_wallet_dir to SH;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> create directory ruby_dblink_wallet_dir as 'ruby_dblink_wallet_dir';

    Directory RUBY_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR created.

    SQL> grant execute on dbms_cloud to SH;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> grant execute on dbms_cloud_admin to SH;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> grant read on directory ruby_dblink_wallet_dir to SH;

    Grant succeeded.
    ```

    </details>

3. Next, let's upload the local wallet files to this directory.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    @~/scripts/adb-07-upload_file.sql /home/oracle/adb_tls_wallet/cwallet.sso RUBY_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR cwallet.sso
    </copy>
    ```

    * *adb-07-upload\_file.sql* will upload a file to an *Oracle Directory* using SQLcl and JavaScript.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text

    Reading local file into stream...
    File read and copied into BLOB stream.
    Saving BLOB to Oracle Directory...
    File successfully written to Oracle directory.
    File uploaded successfully.
    ```

    </details>

4. Check if file was uploaded.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select * from dbms_cloud.list_files('ruby_dblink_wallet_dir');
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text

    ```

    </details>

5. Now connect as SH user. Create the DB link credentials.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    conn sh/oracle@sapphire_tp

    begin
      dbms_cloud.create_credential(
        credential_name => 'F1_RUBY_CRED',
        username => 'F1',
        password => 'oracle');
    end;
    /
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Please note that *username* and *password* are case sensitive.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> conn sh/oracle@sapphire_tp

    Connected.
    SQL> begin
      2    dbms_cloud.create_credential(
      3      credential_name => 'F1_RUBY_CRED',
      4      username => 'F1',
      5      password => 'oracle');
      6  end;
      7* /

    PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
    ```

    </details>

6. Create the DB link and test it.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    begin
      dbms_cloud_admin.create_database_link(
        db_link_name => 'F1',
        hostname => 'adb-free',
        port => '1522',
        service_name => 'ruby_tp.adb.oraclecloud.com',
        ssl_server_cert_dn => 'CN=93ced68f921a',
        credential_name => 'F1_RUBY_CRED',
        directory_name => 'RUBY_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR');
    end;
    /

    select count(*) from F1_RESULTS@F1;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * To get CN (Common Name), you can run: *openssl x509 -in ~/adb\_tls\_wallet/adb\_container.cert -noout -subject*

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text

      7      ssl_server_cert_dn => 'CN=93ced68f921a',
      8      credential_name => 'F1_RUBY_CRED',
      9      directory_name => 'RUBY_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR');
     10  end;
     11* /

    PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

    SQL> select count(*) from F1_RESULTS@F1;

       COUNT(*)
    ___________
          26439
    ```

    </details>

7. Close SQLcl.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 5: Comparing objects metadata

Let's now try the same code on the *SAPPHIRE* database. However, we need to create a database link to the source environment first, so we can compare more easily.

1. Still in the *yellow* ðŸŸ¨ terminal, connect to the *SAPPHIRE* ADB. This is our target database.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    . adb
    sql admin/Welcome_1234@sapphire_tp
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Create a directory to keep the wallet files.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    create directory blue_dblink_wallet_dir as 'blue_dblink_wallet_dir';
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> create directory blue_dblink_wallet_dir as 'blue_dblink_wallet_dir';

    Directory BLUE_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR created.
    ```

    </details>

3. Next, let's upload the local wallet files to this directory.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    @~/scripts/adb-07-upload_file.sql /home/oracle/client_tls_wallet/cwallet.sso BLUE_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR cwallet.sso
    </copy>
    ```

    * *adb-07-upload\_file.sql* will upload a file to an *Oracle Directory* using SQLcl and JavaScript.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    Reading local file into stream...
    File read and copied into BLOB stream.
    Saving BLOB to Oracle Directory...
    File successfully written to Oracle directory.
    File uploaded successfully.
    ```

    </details>

4. Check if file was uploaded.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select * from dbms_cloud.list_files('blue_dblink_wallet_dir');
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>

    ```

    </details>

5. Create the DB link credentials.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    begin
      dbms_cloud.create_credential(
        credential_name => 'SYSTEM_BLUE_CRED',
        username => 'SYSTEM',
        password => 'oracle');
    end;
    /
    </copy>

      4      username => 'SYSTEM',
      5      password => 'oracle');
      6  end;
      7* /

    PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
    ```

    </details>

6. Create the DB link and test it.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    begin
      dbms_cloud_admin.create_database_link(
        db_link_name => 'SOURCE_DBLINK',
        hostname => 'hol-server',
        port => '1522',
        service_name => 'blue',
        ssl_server_cert_dn => 'CN=holserv1',
        credential_name => 'SYSTEM_BLUE_CRED',
        directory_name => 'BLUE_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR');
    end;
    /

    select * from dual@SOURCE_DBLINK;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

      5      port => '1522',
      6      service_name => 'blue',
      7      ssl_server_cert_dn => 'CN=holserv1',
      8      credential_name => 'SYSTEM_BLUE_CRED',
      9      directory_name => 'BLUE_DBLINK_WALLET_DIR');
     10  end;
     11* /

    PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

    SQL> select * from dual@SOURCE_DBLINK;

    DUMMY
    ________

    ```

    </details>

7. Count the number of objects grouped by types in the target database and compare it to the source database.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects where owner in ('HR','PM','IX','SH','BI') group by object_type
    minus
    select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects@source_dblink where owner in ('HR','PM','IX','SH','BI') group by object_type;
    </copy>
    ```

    <summary>*Output:*</summary>

    ``` text
    OBJECT_TYPE       COUNT(*)
    ______________ ___________
    CREDENTIAL               1
    ```

    * The only difference is the extra credential we created for the previous database link.
    * It does not mean that there are no differences between the source and target.
    * This is just a simple count.

8. Also, check the total number of constraints, as they are not on dba_objects, grouped by tables, in the target database and compare it to the source database.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select owner, table_name, count(table_name)
    from dba_constraints where owner in ('HR','PM','IX','SH','BI') group by owner, table_name
    minus
    select owner, table_name, count(table_name)
    from dba_constraints@source_dblink where owner in ('HR','PM','IX','SH','BI') group by owner, table_name;
    </copy>
    ```

    <summary>*Output:*</summary>

    ``` text
    no rows selected
    ```

    * Again, it does not mean that there are no differences between the source and target.
    * This is just a simple count.

9. Even though total number of tables match, let's compare now the dba_tables:

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    ! cat /home/oracle/scripts/adb-09-dba_tables-compare.sql

    @/home/oracle/scripts/adb-09-dba_tables-compare.sql
    </copy>

         dst_tab as (select /*+ materialize */ owner,table_name,logging,iot_type,monitoring,segment_created,external from dba_tables where owner in ('F1','HR','PM','IX','SH','BI'))
    select *
    from (
        (
        select 'src' env, t.* from src_tab t
        minus
        select 'src', t.* from dst_tab t
        )
    union all
        (
        select 'dst' env, t.* from dst_tab t
        minus
        select 'dst', t.* from src_tab t
        )
    )
    order by owner, table_name, env desc
    ;

    8 rows selected.
    ```

    </details>

10. From the output, we can check that:

    * *HR.COUNTRIES* was IOT in source but was converted to HEAP on target.

        Index-organized tables are not supported, but attempting to create one does not generate an error.
        Instead, a heap-organized table with a primary key index is created.
        Therefore, if you use index-organized tables, you should test the applications that use index-organized tables to confirm that they work using heap-organized tables with a primary key indexes.

    * *SH.SALES\_TRANSACTIONS\_EXT* was an EXTERNAL in source but was converted to HEAP on target.

        This is a problem we have to fix.

    * *SYS\_IOT\_OVER\_NNNNN* tables are internal objects that only differ on the sequence and can be ignored.

        This can be ignored.

## Task 6: Fix the Directories issue

When we perform a Data Pump schema export/import, directories are not moved as those objects are owner by SYS. On the CPAT report, we could check there are some directories that are used by those schemas. As External Tables depends on Directories, let's fix it first.

1. Create same directories as source database:

    Let's check the directories that needs to be created:

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select grantee,directory_name,directory_path,privilege
    from dba_tab_privs@source_dblink t1, dba_directories@source_dblink t2
    where t1.table_name = t2.directory_name
    and   t1.grantee in ('HR','PM','IX','SH','BI');
    </copy>
    ```

    <summary>Output</summary>

    ``` text
    GRANTEE    DIRECTORY_NAME    DIRECTORY_PATH                                PRIVILEGE
    __________ _________________ _____________________________________________ ____________
    SH         DATA_FILE_DIR     /u01/app/oracle/sample-apps/sales_history/    READ
    PM         MEDIA_DIR         /u01/app/oracle/sample-apps/product_media/    READ
    SH         LOG_FILE_DIR      /u01/app/oracle/sample-apps/log               READ
    SH         LOG_FILE_DIR      /u01/app/oracle/sample-apps/log               WRITE
    ```

    Create directories and grant permissions to users:

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    create directory data_file_dir as 'sample-apps/sales_history';

    grant read on directory data_file_dir to SH;

    create directory log_file_dir as 'sample-apps/log';

    grant read,write on directory log_file_dir to SH;

    create directory media_dir as 'sample-apps/product_media';

    grant read on directory log_file_dir to PM;

    grant read on directory data_pump_dir to SH;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Please note we also added *DATA\_PUMP\_DIR* as this is a requirement for external tables as of 23.8.

    ```

    </details>

## Task 7: Fix the External Table issue

In ADB Serverless, the syntax to create an external table is different. We must use DBMS\_CLOUD. Let's fix it.

1. Let's first check if the objects are really different on ADB:

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select count(*) from sh.sales_transactions_ext;

    select count(*) from sh.sales_transactions_ext@source_dblink;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The heap table created on the ADB has no rows on it.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> select count(*) from sh.sales_transactions_ext;

       COUNT(*)
    ___________
              0

    SQL> select count(*) from sh.sales_transactions_ext@source_dblink;

       COUNT(*)
    ___________
         916039

    ```

    </details>

2. Now, switch to the *blue* ðŸŸ¦ terminal. Set the environment to *ADB* and get the DDL for this table.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    . adb

    impdp userid=admin/Welcome_1234@sapphire_tp \
    directory=nfs_dir \
    dumpfile=schemas_export_%L.dmp \
    sqlfile=sh.sales_transactions_ext.sql \
    tables=sh.sales_transactions_ext

    cat /nfs_mount/sh.sales_transactions_ext.sql
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The heap table created on the ADB has no rows on it.

3. The generate DDL is:

    ```text
    CREATE TABLE "SH"."SALES_TRANSACTIONS_EXT"
       ( "PROD_ID" NUMBER,
         "CUST_ID" NUMBER,

           )
        )
       REJECT LIMIT 100 ;
    ```

    We can see it points to 2 just created directories: *DATA\_FILE\_DIR* and *LOG\_FILE\_DIR*.

4. Now, switch back to the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Next, let's upload the local external table file, *sale1v3.dat*, to the same directory.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    @~/scripts/adb-07-upload_file.sql /u01/app/oracle/sample-apps/sales_history/sale1v3.dat DATA_FILE_DIR sale1v3.dat

    </details>

5. Check if file was uploaded.

    ``` sql

    select * from dbms_cloud.list_files('data_file_dir');
    </copy>
    ```

    </details>

6. Now connect as SH user. Create the external table and test it.

    ``` sql

              "UNIT_COST" NUMBER(10,2),
              "UNIT_PRICE" NUMBER(10,2)');
       END;
    /

    SQL> rename sales_transactions_ext to sales_transactions_ext_old;

    Table renamed.

    ```

    </details>

    Now the external table is fixed and returning the same ammount of rows as on the source environment.

## Task 8: What about the MEDIA_DIR directory?

After creating the missing directories, *DATA\_FILE\_DIR* and *LOG\_FILE\_DIR* were used by the *SH* external table. What about the *MEDIA\_DIR* directory?

Actually, this directory is used by BFILEs of the PM.PRINT\_MEDIA. We need to fix that.

* Note: BFILEs are large data objects stored in the server's operating system files outside the database tablespaces.

1. Still in the *yellow* ðŸŸ¨ terminal, check the PM.PRINT\_MEDIA table structure.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    conn admin/Welcome_1234@sapphire_tp

    desc PM.PRINT_MEDIA
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN

    AD_HEADER                       ADHEADER_TYP

    SQL>
    ```

    </details>

2. Check what are the files and directories refenced by this table.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    WITH
      FUNCTION GET_DIR_NAME (BF BFILE) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
        DIR_ALIAS VARCHAR2(255);
        FILE_NAME VARCHAR2(255);
      BEGIN
        IF BF IS NULL THEN
          RETURN NULL;
        ELSE
          DBMS_LOB.FILEGETNAME(BF, DIR_ALIAS, FILE_NAME);
          RETURN DIR_ALIAS || ' ' || FILE_NAME;
        END IF;
      END;
    SELECT GET_DIR_NAME(AD_GRAPHIC)
      FROM PM.PRINT_MEDIA;
    </copy>
    ```

    <summary>*Output:*</summary>

    ``` text

    MEDIA_DIR monitor.jpg
    MEDIA_DIR mousepad.jpg
    MEDIA_DIR keyboard.jpg

    ```

    * There are just 4 files that we need to replicate from the original directory to ADB directory.
    * Ideally, this could be a good opportunity for having this directory now converted to a object storage or NFS.

3. Move the missing files do ADB.

    We need to connect back with ADMIN, as PM user has no *WRITE* privileges under this directory.
