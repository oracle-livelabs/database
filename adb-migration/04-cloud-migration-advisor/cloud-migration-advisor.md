# Cloud Migration Advisor

## Introduction

In this lab, you will see use Cloud Migration Advisor (CMA) to get the recommended migration method for each database and check which is the easiest to move.

Estimated Time: 15 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Open Cloud Migration Advisor
* Upload CPAT findings
* Generate report

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

* You have completed Lab 3: Evaluate Database Compatibility

This is an optional lab. You can skip it if you are already familiar with CMA.

## Task 1: Download and open CMA

CMA is available for everyone and shared on request. The tool is licensed under Oracle Free Use Terms and Conditions (FUTC).

If you are interest on the tool, you can request a copy from the Upgrades, Migration and Patching Product Management Team via our social media, e-mail or website.

In this lab, CMA is already configured and available at *[https://localhost/ords/r/cma/cma](https://localhost/ords/r/cma/cma)*.

1. Double-click on the *ADB_Actions* shortcut on the desktop.

## Task 2: Run CMA Guided Mode

Cloud Migration Advisor is a tool with many options and flows. In this lab, we will use it in a simple mode, just to get the recommended method for the two PDBs that we want to move to ADB.

1. In the top left corner, click on the *hamburger icon* and click on *Guided Mode*.

2. The guide mode opens a pop-up. Read the introduction and click *Next* and go to "Step 1".

3. On "Step 1", select *I have my target defined. What is the best migration method?* option.

7. Click *Open* and next *Upload*. It will show "1" database loaded.

## Task 3: Check CMA Solution Report

1. The solution report page opens. Examine it.

    * CMA recommends using "Data Pump Conventional Export/Import" for both databases.
    * The CPAT report that you uploaded were based on all migration methods. CMA scans and shows which one would be the most simple.
    * CMA is showing that RED database is less complex to move (scored 9.19) than the BLUE database (scored 9.00). This is because RED has less CPAT findings than BLUE. Notice the "Checks" columns.

2. Click on the *Solution# 1* link at the breadcrumb bar.

3. On the *Solution* overview, click on *Checks Report* button in the upper right corner.

4. When the *Checks Report* open, you can view all CPAT checks for both databases, and their CPAT status.

    ![CMA Checks](./images/cma-checks.png)

5. Find the *has_directories* check and the select row. Only the first 10 rows are shown. You may have to go to the next rows to find the check.

6. Now, scroll to the end of the page. Notice that on the "Databases" report table at the bottom, you can check the list of affected objects for that specific check.

You may now [*proceed to the next lab*](#next).
