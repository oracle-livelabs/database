## About this Workshop

Welcome to this workshop in which you’ll follow step-by-step instructions to build the MovieHub application powered by MySQL HeatWave. MovieHub is a fictitious movie streaming application that delivers personalized recommendations using machine learning. It leverages the built-in HeatWave AutoML recommender system to predict, for example, movies that a user will like, or to which users a given movie should be promoted. You’ll build this app using the most popular low-code development platform, Oracle APEX, which will also enable you to create analytics dashboards in the application. You’ll develop a few scenarios both from the user's and the administrator's perspective.

_Estimated Lab Time:_ 3.5 hours

## About Product/Technology

MySQL HeatWave is the only cloud service that combines transactions, real-time analytics across data warehouses and data lakes, and machine learning in one MySQL Database—without the complexity, latency, risks, and cost of ETL duplication. It delivers unmatched performance and price-performance. HeatWave AutoML enables in-database machine learning, allowing you to build, train, deploy, and explain machine learning models within MySQL HeatWave. You do not need to move the data to a separate ML cloud service, or be an ML expert. MySQL Autopilot provides machine learning-powered automation that improves the performance, scalability, and ease of use of HeatWave, saving developers and DBAs significant time. The service can be deployed in OCI, AWS, Azure, in a hybrid environment, and in customers’ data centers with OCI Dedicated Region.
