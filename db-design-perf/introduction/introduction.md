# Introduction                                   

The labs in this workshop walk you through a series of activities to tap into the full performance potential of the **Oracle Autonomous Database** through good Database Design. You will provision a new autonomous database instance in the Oracle Cloud, connect to the database using Database Actions and Cloud Shell, conduct an initial performance benchmark, and then optimise the design for both single session throughput and concurrent throughput.

With Oracle Autonomous Database, we make it quick and easy for you to create a secure, fully managed database service in the Oracle Cloud and start building applications and then optimising the database design immediately.

### **What is an Autonomous Database?**
An autonomous database is a cloud database that uses machine learning to automate database security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by DBAs. Unlike a conventional database, an autonomous database performs all these tasks (and more) without human intervention. We take care of everything for you.

Oracle's Autonomous Database is the perfect quick-start service for building modern applications for the cloud. Oracle manages everything for you so you can focus on building great applications for your customers.

Estimated Workshop Time: 70 minutes

### Workshop Prerequisites
This workshop requires an Oracle Cloud account. 

<if type="freetier>You may use your personal cloud account, a cloud account you obtained through a trial, a Free Tier account, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

*Note: If you have a **Free Trial** account, your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account when your Free Trial expires. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)***
</if>
<if type="livelabs">Because you have chosen to use a Livelabs Sandbox environment, the Livelabs system has created a Sandbox environment for you. After a certain amount of time, the Sandbox will be destroyed, including all objects you created.

*Note: If you want to continue working with Oracle OCI, even after the Livelabs Sandbox has been destroyed, you can opt for an Oracle OCI **Free Trial** account. When your Free Trial expires, your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)***
</if>
