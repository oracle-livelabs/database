# Introduction                                   

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle AI Database** and perform simple operations on tables. While this workshop applies equally to either on-premises databases or cloud-based databases in an Oracle Autonomous AI Database cloud service, the labs will show how to get started using an Oracle Autonomous AI Database.

You will provision a new Oracle Autonomous AI Database instance in the Oracle Cloud, connect to the database using a SQL Worksheet, perform queries, and create a schema in which you will create a user, assign privileges, and create tables.

With Oracle Autonomous AI Database we make it quick and easy for you to create a secure, fully managed database service in the Oracle Cloud and start analyzing data immediately.

### **What is an Oracle AI Database?**
In general, a database is a collection of data treated as a unit. A database management system (DBMS) stores, manages and retrieves a large amount of data in a multi-user environment so that many users can access the same data concurrently.

Oracle AI Database is a robust object relational database that provides efficient and effective solutions for database users such as delivering high performance, protecting users from unauthorized access, and enabling fast failure recovery.

### **What is an Oracle Autonomous AI Database?**
An autonomous database is a cloud database that uses machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by DBAs. Unlike a conventional database, an autonomous database performs all these tasks and more without human intervention. You don’t need to spend time thinking about how you should store your data, when or how to back it up or how to tune your queries. We take care of everything for you.

Oracle’s Autonomous AI Database is the perfect quick-start service for fast data loading and sophisticated data reporting and analysis. Oracle manages everything for you so you can focus on your data.

Estimated Workshop Time: 70 minutes

### Workshop Prerequisites
- An Oracle Cloud Account

## Workshop Objectives
- Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
- Provision a new Oracle Autonomous AI Database Serverless instance
- Run sample queries against the sample data sets
- Create a schema, create a user, assign privileges, and create tables

### Lab Breakdown
- **Lab 1:** Provision your first Oracle Autonomous AI Database.
- **Lab 2:** Connect to the database using a SQL Worksheet.
- **Lab 3:** Familiarize with the structures and data in the Sales History (SH) sample schema that comes with the database.
- **Lab 4:** Query the SH sample schema.
- **Lab 5:** Create a user (schema), assign privileges to the user, create tables, add and maintain records, and maintain the schema.
