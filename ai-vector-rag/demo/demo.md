# Lab 1: Running a RAG Application

### Introduction 
Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will run a RAG application interactively using a user-friendly interface. You’ll be able to choose and load several PDF documents and ask your own questions using a prompt. This setup will allow you to easily interact with the RAG system and observe how it processes and generates responses in real time.

## Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Open the Notebook Environment
This task will have you login to the Jupyter environment and run specific notebooks for this lab.

1. **If you have already logged into the Jupyter environment skip to step 5, otherwise** open "**View Login Info**" section of your workshop.

2. Copy the Jupyter Notebook Password and click the Jupyter Notebook URL.

3. Paste the Jupyter Notebook Password you copied in the previous step into the Notebook.

4. You should be within the Jupyter Notebooks landing screen. 

5. In the menu at the top click on **File** then click on **New** Then click on **Terminal**
6. In the terminal copy and paste the code below
   ````
   <copy>
   cd /home/oracle
   /home/oracle/run.sh
   </copy>
   ````

7. Three URLs will appear. Click on the last URL labeled **External URL:**

## Task 2: Run the application

1. Once your application is running, simply follow the steps in the user interface.

Feel free to explore the documents with your own questions and discover how the RAG application can retrieve and provide accurate responses based on the document’s content.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
