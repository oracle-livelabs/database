**_Estimated Time: 10 Minutes_**

### **Objectives**

In this lab, you will run a RAG application interactively using a user-friendly interface. You’ll be able to choose and load several PDF documents and ask your own questions using a prompt. This setup will allow you to easily interact with the RAG system and observe how it processes and generates responses in real time.

### **Prerequisites**
This lab assumes you have:
- All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Open the Jupyter Notebook Interface

1. In the upper-left corner, select **View Login Info**.

## Task 2: Run the RAG Application

1. In the top navigation bar, open the terminal by clicking **File** >> **New** >> **Terminal**.

2. In the terminal, copy and paste the code below.
      ````
      <copy>
      cd /home/oracle
      /home/oracle/run.sh
      </copy>
      ````
      ![Run the code snippet in the terminal.](images/lab1-6-terminal-commands.png)

3. The above commands will start a streamlit application running your Chatbot. Three URLs will appear. Click on the last URL to interact with the application from your browser.

4. You should now see the landing page of the application you'll be building shortly. Explore the application by following the instructions on the landing page. Feel free to explore the documents with your own questions and discover how the RAG application can retrieve and provide accurate responses based on the document’s content.

   Once finished you can return to these instructions.
