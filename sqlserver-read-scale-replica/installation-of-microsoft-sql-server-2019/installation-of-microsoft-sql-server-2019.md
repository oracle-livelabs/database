# Provision of the Compute Instance from Market Place Image for SQL Server 2019

## Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to provision Microsoft SQL Server 2019 from the Market Place Image in a Compute Instance.

Estimated Time:  1 hour 30 min

### Objectives
In this lab, you will learn to:
* Deploy Microsoft SQL Server 2019 from the marketplace image
* Register the Computer Instances to Active Directory Domain Controller

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- A Free or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- IAM policies to create resources in the compartment
- Required Subnets are available in VCN

##  Task 1: Provision the SQL Server 2019 from Market Place for Primary Replica

1. Open the navigation menu, click **Marketplace**, and then click **All Applications**.

  ![OCI Marketplace](./images/compute-instance-oci.png "OCI Marketplace")

2. Marketplace **All Applications** will be shown below. Search for **SQL Server 2019** image and select the desired edition for SQL Server. The marketplace image is available in Enterprise and Standard Edition. Always On Basic Availability Groups provide a high availability solution for SQL Server from version 2016 and above on Standard Edition. An Availability Group supports a failover environment for a single database in Standard Edition.

3. Choose the compartment and click on **Launch Instance**. It will take the screen to the launch Compute Instance.

  ![OCI launch Instance](./images/compute-instance-compartment.png "OCI launch Instance")

> **Note: You will be charged a minimum of 744 hours for the MS SQL Server Marketplace image.

4. Choose the Instance name and compartment, and select the desired Availability Domain.

5. Click on **Change Shape** to select the shape of the Instance.

6. Choose the compartment where the Compute Instance should reside, and then choose the private subnet as shown below the image.

  ![OCI Compute Instance VCN](./images/compute-instance-compart.png "OCI Compute Instance VCN")

7. Choose the default values and click on the **Create** Instance.

8. Once the Compute Instance is provisioned, you can see the Instance state is running.

##  Task 2: Add the Primary Replica Server to Active Directory Domain

1. RDP to the bastion host and login to the Node1 server using the private IP.

2. Open **Control Panel**and navigate to **Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center**.

  ![Windows network and sharing center](./images/windows-controlpanel.png "Windows network and sharing center")

3. Click on **Ethernet** connection, then click on **properties**.

  ![network and sharing ethernet properties](./images/windows-network-ethernet.png " ")
4. Click on **IPv4**, and then click on **properties**. Choose the ****Use the following DNS Server Addresses:** and enter the private IP address of the Domain you created in Lab1, then click **OK** to save the changes.

  ![Ethernet IP addresses](./images/windows-network-ip.png "Ethernet IP addresses")

5. Open the File Explorer, right-click on **This PC**, and then click on **properties**.
  ![Windows system properties](./images/windows-network-properties.png "Windows system properties")

6. The following popup will be opened, and click on **Change Settings**.

  ![Windows system change settings](./images/windows-network-changesettings.png " ")

7. Click on **Computer Name**, and then click on **Change**. Choose **Domain** and enter the domain name, then click **OK** to save the changes.

  ![Windows system name change](./images/windows-network-changedomain.png "Windows system name change")

8. The system will prompt for the domain administrator **username** and **password**. Provide the **domainname\username**and **password**, and then click on **OK** to apply the changes.

  ![Domain credentials](./images/windows-network-changepass.png "Domain credentials")

9. On successfully adding the server to the Domain, you can see the successful message shown below.

  ![Change in computer name](./images/windows-network-successful.png "Change in computer name")

10. The system will ask for a restart popup message on the screen. Click on "OK" to reboot the system.

  ![System restart popup message](./images/windows-restart.png "System restart popup message")

11. The system will prompt the popup on the screen, and then click on **Restart Now**.  

  ![System restart](./images/windows-restart-popup.png "System restart")

12. To view the **complete computer name**, open the **Control Panel** and then go to **System and SecuritySystem**.

##  Task 3: Provision the SQL Server 2019 from Market Place for Secondary Replica

* Repeat all steps from **Task 1** to provision the Microsoft SQL Server from Marketplace for Secondary Replica in the different private subnet.

##  Task 4: Add the Secondary Replica Server to Active Directory Domain

* Repeat all steps from **Task 2** to add the Secondary Replica Server to Active Directory Domain in the different private subnet.

##  Task 5: Download and install SQL Server Management Studio in Primary as well as Secondary Replica servers

1. Download and install SQL Server Management Studio [link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2195969&clcid=0x409) from the browser.

  ![OCI Compute Instance status](./images/managementstudiodownload.png "OCI Compute Instance status")

2. Click on **SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe** to install the SQL Server Management Studio. The installation process is shown in the following image. 

  ![SQL Server Management Studio installation progress](./images/sqlservermanagementstudioinstallation.png "SQL Server Management Studio installation progress")

3. The successful installation process is shown in the following image. 

  ![SQL Server Management Studio installation status](./images/sqlservermanagementstudiostatus.png "SQL Server Management Studio installation status")

  You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
