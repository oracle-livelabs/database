# Unplug-plug - Upgrade

## Introduction

In this lab, you will unplug a PDB (PDB3) from a CDB (CDB1) running on Oracle Database 12.2.0.1. Then, you plug it into a higher release CDB (CDB2) running on Oracle Database 19c and upgrade the PDB.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Prepare environment
* Analyze the PDB
* Unplug-plug upgrade

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 1: Initialize Environment

## Task 1: Prepare environment

1. Use the yellow terminal. Log in to the source CDB.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb1
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>
    ```

2. Start it up and verify that PDB3 is open in *read write* mode.
    ```
    <copy>
    startup
    show pdbs
    exit
    </copy>

    Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    </details>

## Task 2: Analyze the PDB
Before you upgrade the PDB, it is a good idea to check it for upgrade readiness. Use AutoUpgrade in *analyze* mode to generate a report.

1. Examine the AutoUpgrade config file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/scripts/PDB3.cfg
    </copy>
    ```

    ``` text
    global.autoupg_log_dir=/home/oracle/logs/lab11
    upg1.source_home=/u01/app/oracle/product/12.2.0.1
    upg1.target_home=/u01/app/oracle/product/19
    upg1.sid=CDB1
    upg1.pdbs=PDB3
    upg1.target_cdb=CDB2
    upg1.target_pdb_copy_option=file_name_convert=none
    ```

    * AutoUpgrade unplugs the PDBs specified by `pdbs`.
    * From the database specified by `sid`.
    * Plugs them into the database specified by `target_cdb`.
    * `target_pdb_copy_option` instructs AutoUpgrade to copy the data files as part of the plug-in operation. Because there is no `file_name_convert` specified, the target database will use OMF and automatically assign file names. 
    * Since AutoUpgrade copies the data files, the source PDB remains intact in CDB1. You can use it for fallback (if necessary).

2. Use AutoUpgrade to analyze the PDB before the upgrade. The analysis is usually fast. Wait for it to complete or use `lsj` command to monitor the progress.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar $OH19/rdbms/admin/autoupgrade.jar -mode analyze -config /home/oracle/scripts/PDB3.cfg
    </copy>
    ```

    ```
    </details>

    AutoUpgrade in analyze mode is a lightweight, non-intrusive check of the database. You can use it on a live database without interrupting users.

3. AutoUpgrade prints the path to the summary report. Check it.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/logs/lab11/cfgtoollogs/upgrade/auto/status/status.log
    </copy>

## Task 3: Unplug-plug upgrade

AutoUpgrade informed you that you are ready to upgrade the PDB. Use AutoUpgrade in *deploy* mode to perform the unplug-plug upgrade.

1. Start AutoUpgrade in *deploy* mode. It will handle the entire operation for you.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar $OH19/rdbms/admin/autoupgrade.jar -mode deploy -config /home/oracle/scripts/PDB3.cfg
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ java -jar $OH19/rdbms/admin/autoupgrade.jar -mode deploy -config /home/oracle/scripts/PDB3.cfg

    Processing config file ...
    +--------------------------------+
    | Starting AutoUpgrade execution |
    +--------------------------------+
    1 PDB(s) will be processed
    Type 'help' to list console commands
    upg> 
    ```
    </details>

    Notice you are using the exact same command line as for the analysis. Only the `-mode` parameter changes.

2. Monitor the upgrade using the `lsj` command. The `-a` parameter instructs AutoUpgrade to refresh the information every 30 seconds.

    ```
    <copy>
    lsj -a 30
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>

    ```
    </details>

3. The upgrade usually completes in 15-20 minutes. AutoUpgrade prints a message stating the job completed.

    Jobs restored                  [0]

    Please check the summary report at:

    /home/oracle/logs/lab11/cfgtoollogs/upgrade/auto/status/status.log
    ```
    </details>

4. Connect to the higher release CDB (CDB2) and ensure that PDB3 is plugged in. 

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb2
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    show pdbs
    exit
    </copy>
     
    Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>

    ```
    </details>    

    Notice how the PDB is open in *read write* mode and unrestricted. This indicates the plug-in and upgrade went fine. Otherwise, AutoUpgrade would also inform you.

Congratulations! You have completed the lab.

## Learn More

You can upgrade PDBs by unplugging from a lower release CDB, plugging it into a higher release CDB, and then upgrading that PDB to the higher release. This is called unplug-plug upgrade. 

When you plug in a lower release PDB, it will open in *restricted* mode. As each PDB has its own dictionary, it needs to be upgraded to match the version of the CDB. PDBs always need to match the version of the CDB$ROOT.
