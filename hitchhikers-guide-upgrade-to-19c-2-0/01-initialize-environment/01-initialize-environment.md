### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Familiarize yourself with the workshop environment
* Initialize the workshop environment

## Task 1: Familiarize yourself with the workshop environment

1. The easiest way to complete the lab is to copy/paste the lab instructions directly into a terminal. Be sure to execute all commands in a code block. After pasting you must hit RETURN.

2. Before copy/pasting take notice of the commands that you execute. It is important to understand what the commands will do.

3. Start a terminal by using the *upgrade* shortcut.

    ![Start a terminal](./images/01-initialize-environment-start-terminal.png " ")

4. The upgrade terminal has two tabs (a yellow one and a blue one). Each tab is a terminal. Throughout the labs you will be instructed which terminal to use. The terminals are referred to as the *yellow terminal* and the *blue terminal*.

## Task 2: Initialize the workshop environment

1. Use the yellow terminal. When you start the lab, the following components should be started.

    - Database Listener
        - LISTENER
    - Database Server Instances
        - FTEX
        - DB12
        - CDB2



3. Ensure the listener is started.

    ```
    <copy>
    ps -ef|grep LISTENER|grep -v grep
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ ps -ef|grep LISTENER|grep -v grep
    oracle    2333     1  0 11:40 ?        00:00:00 /u01/app/oracle/product/19/bin/tnslsnr LISTENER -inherit
    ```
    </details>

4. Ensure that the databases (FTEX, DB12 and CDB2) are started.

    ```
    <copy>
    ps -ef|grep ora_|grep pmon|grep -v grep
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ ps -ef|grep ora_|grep pmon|grep -v grep
    oracle    2481     1  0 11:40 ?        00:00:00 ora_pmon_FTEX
    oracle    2929     1  0 11:40 ?        00:00:00 ora_pmon_DB12
    oracle    3893     1  0 11:40 ?        00:00:00 ora_pmon_CDB2
    ```
    </details>

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
