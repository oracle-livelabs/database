# Introduction to Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory

## Introduction
Welcome to this 4-part workshop series. This workshop will guide you through the **Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory (Agent Factory)**, demonstrating how enterprises rapidly build and deploy Generative AI Agents privately and securely.

**Estimated time:** 5 minutes.

### Objectives

This workshop has 4 core objectives:

1. Install and Configure the Private Agent Factory
2. Build your First Agent
3. Bootstrap Agents from Templates
4. Customize Agents with the Agent Builder UI

Users are encouraged to skip around to the lab most pertinent to them.

### Prerequisites

* OCI Tenancy with ability to create compute instance, Oracle AI Database Autonommous Database, Resource Manager, Marketplace, VCN with public-subnet.

## Task 1: The Big Picture: From AI to Agentic AI
To understand the Private Agent Factory, we must first look at the broader landscape of artificial intelligence. The evolution of AI moves through several distinct phases:

*   **AI & ML:** Turning raw data into actionable decisions through supervised and unsupervised learning.
*   **Deep Learning:** Utilizing multi-layered neural networks for complex tasks like image and video generation.
*   **Generative AI:** Generating content and code at scale using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   **AI Agents:** Executing complex tasks autonomously using tool orchestration and context management.
*   **Agentic AI:** The final frontier where systems automate entire processes through long-term autonomy, multi-agent collaboration, and self-reflection.

The Private Agent Factory is your gateway to this final stage, allowing you to build "Agentic Flows" that just work.

## Task 2: What is Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory?
The **Agent Factory** is a **no-code platform** designed to help enterprises rapidly build and deploy intelligent AI agents. It is built on the fundamental principle that **an agent is only as powerful as the data it can access and the actions it can take.** 

Unlike disparate database strategies that focus on complex integration, Agent Factory utilizes the **converged AI Database architecture** from Oracle AI Database 26ai. This empowers developers, IT teams, and business users to focus on **innovation** rather than plumbing, as data and AI services exist within the same secure ecosystem.

## Task 3: Learn Key Tenets of Agent Factory
Agent Factory allows you to build production grade AI Agents quickly with the following key principles throughout the lifecycle of an agent:

* **Simplicity:** Features a converged architecture and a drag-and-drop, no-code **Agent Builder**.
* **Safety:** Includes built-in guardrails and agent evaluation tools to mitigate hallucinations.
* **Security:** Maintains existing data security with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
* **Portability:** Uses the **Open Agent Spec**, allowing you to import or export agents across OCI, Azure, AWS, and GCP.
* **Performance:** Leverages **Vector AI Search** and in-database execution for maximum speed.
* **Privacy:** Offers **air-gapped options** for data, LLMs, and agents to ensure your proprietary information never leaves your control.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
