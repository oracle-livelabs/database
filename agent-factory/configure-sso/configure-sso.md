# Configure SSO on Your Private Agent Factory

## Introduction

In this lab session, you will learn how to leverage the Single Sign On (SSO) and User Management features and use them to create users and assign specific access permissions.

The **Single Sign-On (SSO)** feature allows administrators to add SSO providers and seamlessly integrate them for accessing Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory. The configuration form enables the entry of key information such as Provider, Client ID, API URLs, and connection details, making it easy to enable secure, streamlined authentication for all users.

The **User Management** feature provides a centralized dashboard for managing users in Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory. Administrators can view key statistics at a glance, such as the total number of users, active users, administrators, and editors.

The User Directory lists all users who have accessed the system via Single Sign-On (SSO), along with their roles, statuses, and last login details. Actions are available for managing user roles and accounts directly from this page.

**Estimated time:** 10 minutes.
