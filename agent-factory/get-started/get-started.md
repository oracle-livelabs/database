# Get Started

## Introduction
**Estimated time:** 5 minutes.

The **Oracle AI Database 26ai Private Agent Factory** is a **no-code platform** that allows organizations to rapidly build and deploy intelligent AI agents within a secure environment. By utilizing a **converged AI Database architecture**, the Factory enables developers and IT teams to focus on innovation rather than complex integration. This workshop is designed to take you through the entire lifecycle of agent creation, from initial infrastructure setup to deploying sophisticated multi-agent systems.

### Objectives
*   Understand the two primary methods for deploying the Private Agent Factory environment.
*   Recognize the prerequisite steps required before accessing the **Agent Studio**.
*   Understand the foundational **S3P3 Framework** that governs enterprise-grade agents: Simplicity, Safety, Security, Portability, Performance, and Privacy.

### Prerequisites
*   Access to an **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancy** if choosing the Marketplace installation path.
*   Basic familiarity with container environments if choosing to install from source.

## Task 1: Choose Your Installation Path
To begin using the Private Agent Factory, you must first establish your environment through one of two methods:

1.  **1a. Installing the Private Agent Factory from the OCI Marketplace:** This is the recommended path if you have an **OCI tenancy**. This process includes a detailed walkthrough of creating a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN), provisioning an **Autonomous AI Database**, and launching the automated stack from the Marketplace.
2.  **1b. Installing the Private Agent Factory from source:** This path leverages the **Portability** pillar of the S3P3 framework, allowing the factory to run in diverse environments, including on-premises or other cloud providers, using the **Open Agent Spec**.

## Task 2: Log in to the Private Agent Factory
Once your installation is complete, you must proceed to **Lab 2: Log in to the Private Agent Factory**. During that session, you will perform the initial administrator registration, connect your **23ai database**, and configure your LLM providers.

**Next Steps:** After completing Lab 1 (installation) and Lab 2 (log in), **you are ready for any other lab in the workshop!** You will be able to explore pre-built agents, use the **Agent Builder** to design code-free agents, and then deploy those agents.
