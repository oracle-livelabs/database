# Get Started

## Introduction

In this lab you'll undestand the high-level network and application architecture, and gather required data for installation on OCI through OCI Marketplace application. We'll be using OCI GenAI Services for LLM Model providers.

Note: Agent Factory can be installed on OCI, local computer/laptop, or other cloud compute instance. Agent Factory allows multiple model providers but in this lab we'll be using OCI GenAI Services.

**Estimated time:** 5 minutes.

### Objectives
* Understand Agent Factory depoloyment architecture on OCI
* Understand pre-requesites and gather required information for installation

### Prerequisites
* Access to an **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancy** with compartment level admin privelages
* Basic familiarity with Oracle AI Database Autonomous AI Database
* Basic understanding of OCI Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
