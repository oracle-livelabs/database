# Install Oracle Autonomous Health Framework (AHF)

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to install AHF either as **root** or as a non-root user. You will also learn how to run AHF on SELinux-enabled systems.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* (Recommended) Install AHF on Linux or UNIX as **root** user in daemon mode
* Install AHF on Linux or UNIX as a non-root user in non-daemon mode
* Run AHF on SELinux-enabled systems
* Uninstall AHF

### Prerequisites

* Oracle recommends installing AHF as the **root** user. For this workshop, run the **sudo su** command to gain **root** access.
* Perl version 5.10 or later installed.

## Task 1: Open a terminal window

1. Lauch remote desktop.
2. Click **Activities** at the upper-left corner, and then click the **Terminal** icon.

    >**Note:** When you log in to the terminal, you will be logging in as the **opc** user.

## Task 2: Install AHF on Linux or UNIX as root user in daemon mode

To obtain the fullest capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Health Framework (AHF), install it as **root**.

If Oracle Autonomous Health Framework is already installed, then reinstalling performs an upgrade to the existing location.

SELinux is a set of kernel mods and user-space tools that provide another layer of system security, precise access control, system-wide admin-defined policies, and improved mitigation for privilege escalation attacks. For more information, see [Use SELinux on Oracle Linux](https://docs.oracle.com/en/learn/ol-selinux/index.html#introduction).

SELinux is already setup in **Enforcing** mode on this Linux box. Refer to Task 5 to install AHF on SELinux-enabled systems.

1. Switch to **root** user.

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo su
    </copy>
    ```
2. Unzip the **AHF-LINUX_<*version*>.zip** file to the **/tmp/ahf22.1.0** directory.

    ```
    <copy>
    unzip /home/opc/Downloads/AHF-LINUX_v22.1.0.zip -d /tmp/ahf22.1.0
    </copy>
    ```
    Command output:

    ```

    inflating: /tmp/ahf22.1.0/README.txt
    inflating: /tmp/ahf22.1.0/oracle-tfa.pub
    ```

3. Run the **ahf_setup** script.

    ```
    <copy>/tmp/ahf22.1.0/ahf_setup</copy>
    ```

    Command output:

## Task 3: Enable or disable Oracle ORAchk or Oracle EXAchk daemon to start automatically

Installing Oracle Autonomous Health Framework as **root** on Linux or Solaris automatically sets up and runs the Oracle ORAchk or Oracle EXAchk daemon.

The daemon restarts at 1 am every day to discover environment changes. The daemon runs a full local Oracle ORAchk check once every week at 3 am, and a partial run of the most impactful checks at 2 am every day through the **oratier1** or **exatier1** profiles. The daemon automatically purges the **oratier1** or **exatier1** profile run that runs daily, after a week. The daemon also automatically purges the full local run after 2 weeks. You can change the daemon settings after enabling **autostart**.

1. To disable auto start:

    ```
    <copy>
    ahfctl compliance -autostop
    </copy>
    ```

    Command output:

    ```
    Removing orachk cache discovery....
    No orachk cache discovery found.

    ```

2. To enable auto start:

    ```
    <copy>
    ahfctl compliance -autostart
    </copy>
    ```

    Command output:

    ```
    .  
    .  
    Successfully copied Daemon Store to Remote Nodes

    .  .  .  

    orachk is using TFA Scheduler. TFA PID: 14895
    Daemon log file location is : /opt/oracle.ahf/data/ll46863-instance-ahf/orachk/user_root/output/orachk_daemon.log
    ```

## Task 4: Install AHF on Linux or UNIX as a non-root user in non-daemon mode

Install Oracle Autonomous Health Framework as a non-root user, for example, **opc**.

>**Note:**
- Perl version 5.10 or later is required to install Oracle Autonomous Health Framework.
- You cannot perform cluster-wide installation as a non-root user.
- Upgrading AHF is not supported if it is installed in non-daemon mode.

Oracle Autonomous Health Framework has reduced capabilities when you install it as a non-root user in non-daemon mode. Therefore, you cannot complete the following tasks:
- Automate diagnostic collections
- Collect diagnostics from remote hosts
- Collect files that are not readable by the Oracle Home owner, for example, **/var/log/messages**, or certain Oracle Grid Infrastructure logs

1. To check if Perl version 5.10 or later is installed:

    ```
    <copy>
    perl -v
    </copy>
    ```
    Command output:

    ```
    This is perl 5, version 26, subversion 3 (v5.26.3) built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi (with 57 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

    ```
2. If you are logged in as **root**, then log out by running the **exit** command at the command prompt.
3. To install as **Oracle home** owner (**opc** user), use the **–ahf_loc** option, and optionally specify the **-notfasetup** option to prevent running any of the Oracle Trace File Analyzer processes:

    ```
    <copy>
    /tmp/ahf22.1.0/ahf_setup -ahf_loc /ahf -notfasetup
    </copy>
    ```
    Command output:

    ```

    AHF Data Directory : /ahf/oracle.ahf/data
    Extracting AHF to /ahf/oracle.ahf
    AHF is deployed at /ahf/oracle.ahf
    ORAchk is available at /ahf/oracle.ahf/bin/orachk
    AHF binaries are available in /ahf/oracle.ahf/bin
    AHF is successfully installed
    Moving /tmp/ahf_install_221000_30040_2022_07_06-13_51_45.log to /ahf/oracle.ahf/data/ll46863-instance-ahf/diag/ahf/
    ```

    The installer script will throw an error as follows if you install AHF as the **root** user.

    ```
    [ERROR] : AHF-00014: AHF Location /ahf/oracle.ahf is not owned by root in directory hierarchy
    ```
For more information, run **ahf_setup -h**.

## Task 5: Run AHF on SELinux-enabled systems

SELinux runs in one of three modes:
- **Disabled:** The kernel uses only DAC rules for access control. SELinux does not enforce any security policy because no policy is loaded into the kernel.
- **Permissive:** The kernel does not enforce security policy rules but SELinux sends denial messages to a log file. This allows you to see what actions would have been denied if SELinux were running in enforcing mode. This mode is intended to used for diagnosing the behavior of SELinux.
- **Enforcing:** The kernel denies access to users and programs unless permitted by SELinux security policy rules. All denial messages are logged as AVC (Access Vector Cache) denials. This is the default mode that enforces SELinux security policy.

You can enable or disable SELinux. When enabled, SELinux can run either in **enforcing** or **permissive** mode.

To configure default SELinux mode, edit the configuration file for SELinux, **sudo vi /etc/selinux/config**, and set the value of the **SELINUX** directive to **disabled**, **enforcing**, or **permissive**.

```
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
```
Setting the value of the SELINUX directive in the configuration file persists across reboots.

>**Note:**
* SELinux is already setup in **Enforcing** mode. DO NOT change the mode and just proceed further with installing AHF.
* If you have performed Task 4: Install AHF on Linux or UNIX as non-root user in non-daemon mode, first uninstall AHF, and then proceed with the following steps.
* Install AHF as the **root** user.

1. Switch to **root** user.

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo su
    </copy>
    ```

2. Check the status of SELinux.    

    ```
    <copy>
    /usr/sbin/getenforce
    </copy>
    ```
    Command output:

    ```
    Enforcing
    ```

    The **getenforce** command returns **Enforcing**, **Permissive**, or **Disabled**.

3. Check the status of SELinux and the policy being used.

    ```
    <copy>
    /usr/sbin/sestatus
    </copy>
    ```
    Command output:

    ```
    SELinux status: enabled
    SELinuxfs mount: /sys/fs/selinux
    SELinux root directory: /etc/selinux
    Loaded policy name: targeted
    Current mode: enforcing
    Mode from config file: enforcing
    Policy MLS status: enabled
    Policy deny_unknown status: allowed
    Memory protection checking: actual (secure)
    Max kernel policy version: 31
    ```

4. Install AHF.

    ```
    <copy>
    /tmp/ahf22.1.0/ahf_setup
    </copy>
    ```

    >**Note:** AHF installer loads the policy and sets relevant contexts.

    Command output:

    Since you have already installed AHF in [Task 2](Task2:InstallAHFonLinuxorUNIXasrootuserindaemonmode), the installer script exits gracefully with a message, **AHF is already installed at /opt/oracle.ahf** as shown below.

    ```
    AHF Installer for Platform Linux Architecture x86_64
    AHF Installation Log : /tmp/ahf_install_221000_33802_2022_07_06-14_00_20.log
    Starting Autonomous Health Framework (AHF) Installation

    Installed AHF Version: 22.1.0 Build Date: 202205292144
    AHF is already running latest version. No need to upgrade.
    ```

    To install AHF, first uninstall, and then install it afresh.

    To uninstall, run **ahfctl uninstall -deleterepo -silent**

5. Check if the policy is loaded successfully.

    ```
    <copy>
    /usr/sbin/semodule -l | grep inittfa-policy
    </copy>
    ```
    Command output:
    ```
    inittfa-policy
    ```
## Task 6: Uninstall the current AHF (version 22.1.0.0.0) installation

Performing Task 2 in Lab 2 requires that you uninstall AHF (version 22.1.0.0.0) before proceeding because in this workshop you can only upgrade AHF from 21.4.3 to 22.1.1.

1. Check the version of AHF installed.

    ```
    <copy>
    tfactl status
    </copy>
    ```

  	Command output:

    ```
    .-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
    | Host                 | Status of TFA | PID   | Port  | Version    | Build ID             | Inventory Status |

    '----------------------+---------------+-------+-------+------------+----------------------+------------------'
    ```

2. Uninstall AHF.

    ```
    <copy>
    ahfctl uninstall -deleterepo -silent
    </copy>
    ```

  	Command output:

    ```
