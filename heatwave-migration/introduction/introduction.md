# Introduction

Welcome to "Migrate From On-Premises to MySQL HeatWave" workshop. The purpose of this LiveLab is to show you, how easy it is to migrate your data into MySQL HeatWave if you are coming from an on-prem environment.

## About this Workshop

The process in order to migrate your on-prem data into MySQL HeatWave is fairly easy, and that is what this workshop will demonstrate.

Whether you are running a MySQL Community/Standard/Enterprise Edition, MariaDB, Percona, or a MySQL instance deployed on an AWS EC2/Compute - just using MySQL Shell and an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account, you can securely dump all your on-prem data into OCI Object Storage Bucket. Once your data is uploaded into an Object Storage bucket, we can then securely load all that dumped data, into a MySQL HeatWave while the database is creating.

If you follow each Lab associated with this workshop thoroughly, all of the above steps that are mentioned will be covered in more detail.
