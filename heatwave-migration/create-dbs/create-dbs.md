# Create an on-premise environment

## Introduction

In this lab, we will setup an on-prem environment in which we install a MySQL Server, MySQL Shell, and then lastly load a sample database into the on-prem MySQL Server.

_Estimated Time:_ 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will be guided through the following tasks:

- Set up an on-prem environment
    - Create and configure Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) in OCI
    - Create SSH Key in OCI using Cloud Shell
    - Setup a Compute Instance
- Install MySQL Community Server and MySQL Shell
- Load a sample database into MySQL

### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Trial or Paid Cloud Account
- An environment where you can install/run a MySQL Server
- Some Experience with MySQL Shell

## Task 1: Create and configure Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) in OCI

1. Login to Oracle Cloud (OCI), click on the “Hamburger” menu on the top left. Navigate to “Networking” and “Virtual Cloud Networks”

    ![OCI Navigation Menu](./images/ham-menu-new.png "oci-hamburger-menu")

    ![OCI Navigation VCN Menu](./images/vcn-menu-new.png "navigate-to-vcn")

2. Once on the Virtual Cloud Networks page, click “Start VCN Wizard” and select “Create VCN with Internet Connectivity”

    ![OCI VCN Page](./images/vcn-wiz-2-new.png "create-vcn")

    ![VCN Wizard](./images/vcn-wiz1-new.png "vcn-wizard")

3. Name your VCN “MySQL-VCN” while making sure you are in the correct Compartment. Leave everything as it is, and click “Next”

    ```bash
    <copy>MySQL-VCN</copy>
    ```

    ![VCN Creation Page](./images/name-vcn-new.png "name-vcn-wizard")

4. Review all the information and click “Create”

    ![Review VCN Creation Page](./images/review-vcn-new.png "review-vcn-wizard")

5. Once the VCN is created, click “View Virtual Cloud Network”

    ![VCN Setup Complete Page](./images/view-vcn-new.png "view-vcn-wizard")

6. Once on the MySQL-VCN page, under “Resources” click “Subnets” and go to the “Private-Subnet-MySQL-VCN”

    ![VCN Subnet Page](./images/resources-vcn-new.png "resources-vcn")

7. On the Private Subnet page, under “Security Lists”, click on “Security List for Private Subnet-MySQL-VCN” and select “Add Ingress Rules”

    ![Security List VCN Private Subnet](./images/sc-vcn-new.png "seclist-vcn")

    ![Add Ingress Rules Button](./images/add-ingr-new.png "add-ingress")

8. For the ‘Source CIDR’ enter “0.0.0.0/0”, select "TCP" for the 'IP Protocol' and for the Destination Port Range, enter “3306,33060”. In the ‘Description’ section, write “MySQL Port Access”

    ```bash
    <copy>0.0.0.0/0</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>3306,33060</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>MySQL Port Access</copy>
    ```

    ![Add Ingress Rule](./images/add-rule-new.png "add-ingress-rule")

## Task 2: Create SSH Key in OCI using Cloud Shell

1. Inside Oracle Cloud, navigate to "Cloud Shell" under 'Developer tools' next to your Home Region

    ![OCI Developer Tools Icon](./images/devtools-new.png "developer-tools")

    ![Cloud Shell Button](./images/devtools-cldshell-new.png "cloud-shell")

2. Once the Cloud Shell loads, it should look similar to this:

    ![Cloud Shell Prompt](./images/cld-shell-prmpt-new.png "cloud-shell-prompt")

3. Inside your Cloud Shell, execute the command to create an SSH key-pair

    ```bash
    <copy>ssh-keygen -t rsa</copy>
    ```

    ![SSH Keygen Command](./images/key-gen.png "key-gen")

    **Note:** keep pressing the enter/return key for each question. Here is what it should look like, your public and private SSH keys will be stored in a directory called .ssh

    ![SSH Keygen Process Complete](./images/ssh-keypair.png "ssh-key-pair")

4. After your public/private rsa key pair has been created, go to the '.ssh' directory and copy the contents of the "id_rsa.pub" file

    ```bash
    <copy>cd .ssh</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>ls</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>cat id_rsa.pub</copy>
    ```

    ![SSH Public Key Contents](./images/ssh-pub-key.png "ssh-pub-key")

## Task 3: Setup a Compute Instance

1. Within Oracle Cloud, go to the Navigation or Hamburger menu and under Compute, select “Instances”

    ![OCI Navigation Compute Menu](./images/compute-new.png "nav-compute")

2. Make sure you are in the right compartment, and click “Create instance”

    ![OCI Compute Page](./images/create-compute-new.png "create-compute")

3. Name your compute instance "MySQL-Compute". For Placement, leave it at default. For Image and Shape, make sure "Oracle Linux 8" is selected and choose an appropriate Shape that fits your needs. Under Networking, make sure the Public Subnet of your MySQL-VCN is selected

    ```bash
    <copy>MySQL-Compute</copy>
    ```

    ![OCI Compute Creation Page](./images/create-compute2-new.png "create-compute2")

    ![Compute Image and Shape](./images/compute-image-new.png "create-compute3")

    ![Networking for Compute](./images/pub-sub-new.png "public-subnet")

4. Lastly for the 'Add SSH keys', select "Paste public keys" and paste the contents of the id_rsa.pub file here that we copied in Step 4 of Lab 1 Task 2. After pasting your public key, leave everything default and click "Create"

    ![Paste Public SSH Key/Create Compute](./images/add-ssh-new.png "pubkey-compute")

5. Your Compute instance will be ready in a few minutes. Copy the Public IP address of your Compute instance afterwards.

    ![Compute Running](./images/ready-compute-new.png "ready-compute")

6. After copying the Public IP of your Compute, open/restore Cloud Shell. Once Cloud Shell loads, perform the ssh command to connect to your Compute instance

    ```bash
    <copy>ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@<your_compute_instance_ip></copy>
    ```

    ![SSH into Compute](./images/ssh-compute-new.png "ssh-into-compute")

## Task 4: Install MySQL Community Edition in your on-prem environment

1. Once you have your on-premise environment/Compute instance ready and are connected to it, download **MySQL Community Edition** on the Compute instance by executing

    ```bash
    <copy>sudo yum install mysql-server -y</copy>
    ```

    ![Install MySQL CE](./images/install-mysql1.png "install-mysql-ce")

    **Note:** MySQL Community Server can also be downloaded by visiting this website: <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>

2. Start the MySQL server after it has been successfully installed onto your Compute instance. Once the server starts, login to MySQL:

    ```bash
    <copy>sudo systemctl start mysqld</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>mysql -uroot --skip-password</copy>
    ```

    ![Start and Login to MySQL](./images/start-mysql1.png "start-mysql")

    **Note:** during the installation of the MySQL server, it created a root account without a password. Therefore we have explicitly specified that there is no password and that the client program should not prompt for one, by providing the --skip-password option.

3. Change the root password

    ```bash
    <copy>ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pASsWordGoesHere';</copy>
    ```

    ![ALTER USER Statement](./images/change-pass2.png "change-root-pass")

    **Note:** after changing your root password, make a note of it or save it. This will be used later.

4. Exit MySQL and download MySQL Shell onto your on-prem environment

    ```bash
    <copy>exit</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>sudo yum install mysql-shell -y</copy>
    ```

    ![Command to install MySQL Shell](./images/install-shell1.png "install-shell")

    **Note:** MySQL Shell can also be downloaded by visiting this website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/

5. Once MySQL Shell is installed on your on-premise environment/Compute, you can login to your MySQL Server by either executing

    ```bash
    <copy>mysqlsh root@localhost</copy>
    ```

    ![MySQL Shell Connecting to MySQL](./images/connect-shell1.png "connect-shell")

    -OR-

    ```bash
    <copy>mysqlsh -uroot -p</copy>
    ```

    ![MySQL Shell Connecting to MySQL](./images/connect-shell2.png "connect-shell2")

## Task 5: Load the sample database into the MySQL on-prem

1. Exit out of your MySQL Server. Download the sample 'world' database onto your Compute instance, unzip the file, and load it onto your on-prem MySQL Server

    ```bash
    <copy>\q</copy>
    ````

    ```bash
    <copy>wget https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/world-db.zip</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>unzip world-db.zip</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>cd world-db</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>mysql -u root -p < world.sql </copy>
    ```

    ![Download/Unzip the Sample Database](./images/download-sample1.png "download-sample-db")

    ![Load Sample Database into MySQL](./images/load-sample1.png "load-sample-db")

    **Note:** additional sample MySQL databases can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html

2. Login to your MySQL on-prem environment using MySQL Shell and check if the sample ‘world’ database was successfully loaded

    ```bash
    <copy>mysqlsh root@localhost</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>\sql</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>SHOW SCHEMAS;</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    <copy>SHOW TABLES IN world;</copy>
    ```

    ![MySQL Shell Connecting to MySQL](./images/connect-shell1.png "connect-shell")

    ![Show Schemas on MySQL](./images/confirm-load1.png "confirm-load-db")

    **Note:** exit MySQL Shell and minimize Cloud Shell afterwards.

    This concludes this lab. You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
