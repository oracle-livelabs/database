To connect to your Oracle Database from a terminal, set the environment variables if not already set. These variables remain in the terminal until you close the terminal window.

> Note that environment variables set in one terminal do not apply automatically to other terminals you may have. If you open a new terminal or have a terminal window already open, then you must set these variables in that terminal to connect to Oracle Database.

In this task, you will set the following environment variables for your Oracle Database.
 - *`$ORACLE_SID`*
 - *`$ORACLE_HOME`*
 - *`$ORACLE_BASE`*

1. Open a terminal window and go to the `bin` directory in Oracle home. For this lab, the location of the `bin` directory is as follows. 

	```
	$ <copy>cd /u01/app/oracle/product/23.4.0/dbhome_1/bin</copy>
	```

1. Set the environment variables with the script, *oraenv*.

	```
	$ <copy>./oraenv</copy>
	```

1. When prompted for `$ORACLE_SID`, enter *orcl*.

	```
	ORACLE_SID = [oracle] ? <copy>orcl</copy>
	The Oracle base has been set to /u01/app/oracle
	```

	> **Note**: Oracle SID is case-sensitive.

	This command sets the variables *`$ORACLE_SID`* and *`$ORACLE_BASE`*. It also sets the *`$ORACLE_HOME`* path, for example, *`/u01/app/oracle/product/23.4.0/dbhome_1`*.

You have set the environment variables for your Oracle Database in the currently active terminal. You can now connect to Oracle Database and run the SQL commands.
