## About this Workshop

Welcome to the serverless world where provisioning instances is a thing of the
past. Oracle NoSQL Database cloud service enables modern application
development in minutes.

**Simply connect and go.**

Unchain yourself from rigid data modeling and use Oracle NoSQL’s rich JSON query
language to go schemaless. Get an in-depth look at the simplicity of the Oracle
NoSQL cloud developer experience and see how Oracle’s own developers make use of
this new development paradigm.

Learn how Oracle NoSQL Database can provide a
delightful developer experience with features such as predictable single-digit
millisecond latencies, multi-region tables, and deep integration with
VS Code, IntelliJ, and Eclipse. Or simply use OCI Code Editor.

This lab is based on data representing the current activity of the customers
using a Video on Demand streaming application. This lab walks you through the
steps to create tables in Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service (NDCS), load data
into the database, and perform basic queries. In addition, it lets you use an
application that was developed by the Oracle NoSQL team which has information
found in this GraphQL API - Activity Tracking.
