# Run the Activity Tracking application

## Introduction

This lab picks up where lab 3 left off. We are going to explore in more detail
the tables we created, load data, and execute queries using a GraphQL application.

_Estimated Lab Time:_ 25 minutes

### Objectives

* Understand the different tables
* Read data with GraphQL API

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Paid Account or Green Button
* Connection to the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service
* Working knowledge of bash shell
* Working knowledge of SQL language


## Task 1: Review the code using OCI Code Editor

In this task we will review the code using OCI Code Editor.

1. Open the OCI Code Editor in the top right menu.

    ![Cloud Editor](./images/cloud-code-editor.png)


2. Go to the Code Editor, and open the file `index.js` in the following directory
`video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/demo-vod` as shown in the screen-shot:

    ![Code](./images/appl-code.png)

    Oracle NoSQL Database offers **flexible deployment** options to suit the needs of
its customers. Whether deploying on an "On-Premises" cluster or utilizing the
Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service, developers and end-users get the latest in
NoSQL technology. Oracle offers a complete range of deployment options to
support your NoSQL database, from on-premises to private cloud to public cloud.

    The function `createNoSQLClient` allows to illustrate this:
    - You can use **Instance Principals** to do the connection to NoSQL Cloud Service as
shown in this code instead of specifying the credentials. Once they are set up,
you can configure your OKE cluster to isolate workloads across node pools,
create a dynamic group, write your policies. Your application connects to Oracle
NoSQL Database Cloud Service by using Instance Principals. You can Deploy your
application using the Kubernetes command line tool kubectl from the
instructions in a manifest file.
e.g. We deploy our image [using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/oracle/nosql-examples/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-oke-oci-cli-demo-vod.yml)

    - In this lab, we are going to be running application code and we need an instance
to run that from. We will run this application using Cloud Shell using another way
called **delegation token**

    - Finally, the default configuration in this code, allows you to do the Connection
to on-premise non-secure configuration. It is not the topic of this Lab but if you
want to learn more [click here](https://github.com/oracle/nosql-examples/blob/master/demo-livelab/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/README.md)

    - Otherwise, the rest of the code is exactly the same.

    When you create a table, you can choose between **Provisioned Capacity** and
**On-Demand Capacity**. With the availability of both models, businesses have total flexibility when
choosing the most cost-effective deployment to meet their business and application
workload requirements. Such flexibility empowers businesses to solely focus on application
innovations to delight their customers, making operational costs "worry-free" in their decision-making process.

    You can also modify the **Capacity mode** from Provisioned Capacity to On Demand Capacity and vice-versa.

    - The function `createTable` allows to illustrate this

    As a developer, you can access your data via an API or SQL. Review the rest of the code,
we are using both APIs to develop our application
    - Get, put, scan APIs for raw key/value pairs and tables â€“ CRUD API
    - SQL for rich access to JSON, more complex filtering expressions
    - Support for conjunctions and disjunctions in filter expressions

    In the next Lab **Explore Data and Run Queries**, we will explore more on detail
 **SQL for rich access to JSON**. But let us continue with this Lab.

## Task 2: Restart the Cloud Shell

 1. Let's get back into the Cloud Shell. From the earlier lab, you may have
 minimized it in which case you need to enlarge it. It is possible it may have
 become disconnected and/or timed out. In that case, restart it.

     ![Cloud Shell](./images/cloud-shell.png)

 2. Execute the following environment setup shell script in the Cloud Shell to
 set up your environment. If you close/open the Cloud Shell Console, please re-execute it.

     ```
     <copy>
     source ~/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/env.sh
     </copy>
     ```

## Task 3: Load Data and Examine It

1. Install the Node.js application. Execute in the Cloud Shell.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/demo-vod
    npm install
    npm install oracle-nosqldb --save
    node index.js &
    </copy>
    ```
    **Note:** This will start the "demo-vod" application in the background.

2. After you complete step 1, you will see a message in the shell saying 'application running'

    ![appl-running](./images/appl-running.png)

    Press the **Enter** key on your keypad to get the command line prompt back.

3. Read back the data that we entered in the Lab 3 using the GraphQL query `Streams`.
Execute in the Cloud Shell.

    ````
    <copy>
    curl --request POST --header 'content-type: application/json' --url 'localhost:3000' \
--data '{"query":"query Streams { streams { id  info { firstName  lastName country } }}"}' | jq
    </copy>
    ````

    This will display all the rows in the table currently without details about shows.

4. Read data for a specific user using the GraphQL query `Stream($streamId: Int)`

    ````
    <copy>
    curl --request POST \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --url 'localhost:3000' \
    --data '{
  "query": "query Stream($streamId: Int) { user1:stream(id: $streamId) {id   info{ country shows {showName}} } }", "variables": { "streamId": 1} }'|jq
    </copy>
    ````

5. Execute one of the reports using the GraphQL queries - For every show aired
by the application, fetch the total watch time by all users

    ````
    <copy>
    curl --request POST \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --url 'localhost:3000' \
    --data '{"query":"query WatchTime { watchTime { showName seasonNum length } } "}'|jq
    </copy>
    ````

6. Insert data into the stream_acct table using the GraphQL mutations.

    This will be done using a curl command to transfer data over the network to the
    NoSQL store using the "demo-vod" application. The shell script will prompt the
    GraphQL and will execute it. Execute in Cloud Shell.

    ````
    <copy>
    cd ~/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/example-graphql-query/
    </copy>
    ````

    ````
    <copy>
    sh create-stream.sh
    sh query-stream-by-id.sh
    </copy>
    ````

    ````
    <copy>
    sh update-stream.sh
    sh query-stream-by-id.sh
    </copy>
    ````


7. You can also execute sql statements using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI commands.
Going this route, you will be querying the data over REST. Execute in Cloud Shell.

    ````
    <copy>
    SQL_STATEMENT="SELECT * from stream_acct a where a.info.country = 'USA'"
    echo "$SQL_STATEMENT"
    </copy>
    ````

    ````
    <copy>
    oci nosql query execute -c  $NOSQL_COMPID --statement "$SQL_STATEMENT"
    </copy>
    ````
  In this case, the data is formatted as a nice JSON document.

7. Load information for 91 users. For the shows, we will insert 5 randoms shows
using a set of 46 shows.

  **Note**: During this load, You can minimize the Cloud Shell and explore the data
  in detail using the NoSQL Console as shown in Lab 3 - Task 4

    ````
    <copy>
    cd ~/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/example-graphql-query/
    sh load.sh
    </copy>
    ````
    If you have an error saying,
    ````
    ls: cannot access ../data/User: No such file or directory
    ````
    it means that you forgot to load the data
    ````
    <copy>
    cd ~/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/data/
    sh unzip.sh
    </copy>
    ````
## Task 4: Create Indexes

In the next Lab **Explore Data and Run Queries**, we will see the power of
**SQL for rich access to JSON**. Before doing it, we will create the indexes on
stream_acct table that will be handy while writing the queries.

You can create these indexes from the OCI console, OCI cli commands, Terraform or directly from your program.

In this task, we will create 3 of 5 indexes using a Node.js program.

1. Review the DDL commands
    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/demo-vod
    more demo-stream-acct-idx*.ddl | cat
    </copy>
    ```

2. Execute the create-table.js application. Execute in the Cloud Shell.
```

    <copy>
    cd ~/video-on-demand-with-nosql-database/demo-vod
    node create-table.js
    </copy>
    ```
