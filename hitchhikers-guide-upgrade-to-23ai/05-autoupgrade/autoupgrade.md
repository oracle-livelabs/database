# AutoUpgrade

## Introduction

In this lab, you will upgrade the *UPGR* database from Oracle Database 19c to 23ai. You will use AutoUpgrade.

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Prepare your environment
* Analyze your database
* Upgrade your database

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 4: Capture and Preserve SQL

## Task 1: Prepare your environment

It is strongly recommended to always use the latest version of AutoUpgrade. To use AutoUpgrade, you must create a config file.

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Set the environment to the *UPGR* database and check the AutoUpgrade version.

    ```
    <copy>
    . upgr
    cd
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -version
    </copy>
    ```

    build.MOS_NOTE 2485457.1
    build.MOS_LINK https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2485457.1
    ```
    </details>

    You use AutoUpgrade from the user's home directory. In fact, you can use AutoUpgrade from any location. It does not matter.

    Check the version. If a newer version is available, you can download it from My Oracle Support ([AutoUpgrade Tool (Doc ID 2485457.1)](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2485457.1)). Don't do this now.

2. To show the many capabilities of AutoUpgrade, create a sample config file. Examine the file to get an idea of the many options in AutoUpgrade. In this lab, you will not use the sample config file.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -create_sample_file config
    more sample_config.cfg
    </copy>
    ```

    # You can have as many databases as desired
    #
    # ----- Unplug/Plug Upgrade -----
    # To perform an Unplug/Plug operation that upgrades and moves one or more PDBs
    # from a source CDB into a target CDB, use the target_cdb and pdbs parameters.
    # The target_pdb_name and target_pdb_copy_option parameters can be used
    # to determine how each PDB is created on the target CDB.
    #
    # ----- NonCDB to PDB conversion -----
    # To upgrade and convert an existing NonCDB database into a PDB of a target CDB,
    # use the target_cdb parameter to specify the destination CDB.
    # The target_pdb_name and target_pdb_copy_option parameters can be used
    # to determine how each PDB is created on the target CDB.
    #
    # When neither of these options are used, a full upgrade of the source DB/CDB is performed.

3. For this lab, you will use a pre-created config file. Examine the pre-created config file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/scripts/UPGR.cfg
    </copy>
    ```

    * `global.autoupg_log_dir` defines the base logging directory where AutoUpgrade stores all logs and other files.
    * `source_home` and `target_home` specify the path to the source and target Oracle home.
    * `sid` contains the SID of the database that you want to upgrade/convert.
    * By specifying `target_cdb` you instruct AutoUpgrade to also perform a non-CDB to PDB conversion.
    * `restoration` defines whether a guaranteed restore point is created before the upgrade.
    * `add_after_upgrade_pfile` points to a file containing the initialization parameters you want to add after upgrade. 
    * `timezone_upg` skips the timezone file upgrade.

    upg1.timezone_upg=NO
    ```
    </details>

    To simulate regression SQLs and to prove our method, this lab changes optimizer behavior using `optimizer_index_cost_adj`. The parameter is added after the upgrade using `add_after_upgrade_pfile`. In a later lab, you will see the effect of this change, and what you can do about it.

## Task 2: Analyze your database

It is best practice to first analyze your database for upgrade readiness. It is a lightweight, non-intrusive check that you can run on a live database.

1. Start AutoUpgrade in *analyze* mode. The check usually completes very fast. Wait for it to complete.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config /home/oracle/scripts/UPGR.cfg -mode analyze
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>

    Please check the summary report at:

    ```
    </details>

3. AutoUpgrade prints the path to the summary report. Check it.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/logs/autoupgrade-UPGR/cfgtoollogs/upgrade/auto/status/status.log
    </copy>

    ------------------------------------------
    ```
    </details>

    * The report states: *Check passed and no manual intervention needed*. AutoUpgrade found no severe issues that it couldn't fix automatically.

4. Check the summary report in HTML format. Also, click on *Checks Report* for even more details. Firefox might print warnings to the console. You can safely ignore those.

    ```
    <copy>
    firefox /home/oracle/logs/autoupgrade-UPGR/cfgtoollogs/upgrade/auto/status/status.html &
    </copy>
    ```
    ![The summary report shows the outcome of the preupgrade analysis](./images/autoupgrade-summary-report.png " ")
    ![The Checks Report shows many details about the database](./images/autoupgrade-checks-report.png " ")

    * Examine the Checks Report.
    * Notice how a specific check has severity *RECOMMENDED*, but AutoUpgrade has a fixup available.
    * Then close Firefox.

## Task 3: Upgrade your database

You determined that the database is ready to upgrade. Start AutoUpgrade in *deploy* mode. One command is all it takes to perform the upgrade and PDB conversion; including all pre- and post-upgrade tasks.

1. Start AutoUpgrade in *deploy* mode to perform the upgrade and conversion. Notice you are re-using the same config file and command, but this time `-mode` is set to `deploy`.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config /home/oracle/scripts/UPGR.cfg -mode deploy
    </copy>
    ```

    </details>

    Notice the *Logfiles* section. This is the location of the relevant log files. Note the *Logs Base* location.

5. Switch to the *blue* terminal ðŸŸ¦. Do not exit AutoUpgrade.

6. Go to the *Logs Base* location.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd /home/oracle/logs/autoupgrade-UPGR/UPGR
    ls -l
    </copy>
    ```

    * Explore the subdirectories.
    * Notice how each job number has its own dedicated directory.

    * Notice that each phase (*preupgrade*, *prefixups*, *drain*, *dbupgrade*, etc.) has its own subdirectory. Explore the subdirectories and log files.

7. Switch back to the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Do not close the *blue* terminal ðŸŸ¦.    

8. You are still connected to the AutoUpgrade console. Monitor the upgrade using the `status` command. The `-a` parameter instructs AutoUpgrade upgrade to refresh the information at a given interval.

    ```
    <copy>
    status -job 101 -a 30
    </copy>
    ```

9. Wait until the upgrade completes. Depending on the lab platform, the upgrade will take about 15-25 minutes. Don't exit from the AutoUpgrade console. Leave it running.

11. Optionally, you can complete some of the labs from tracks 2 and 3. Check *Introduction* for details

10. When the upgrade completes, AutoUpgrade prints a message saying *Job 101 completed* and exits from the AutoUpgrade console.

**Congratulations! You upgraded the UPGR database successfully from Oracle Database 19c to 23ai and converted your database to a PDB.**

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.

AutoUpgrade completely automates upgrades and incorporates our best practices. AutoUpgrade run all prechecks against multiple databases, fix potential issues, set a restore point in case something goes wrong, before it finally upgrade and convert your databases. And of course, do the postupgrade checks, recompilation and time zone adjustment. The only thing you need to provide is a config file in text format.
