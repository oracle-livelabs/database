# SQL Tuning Advisor

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use SQL Tuning Advisor (SQL Tuning Advisor) to find suggestions for improving SQLs.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a tuning task
* Implement recommendations
* Validate recommendations using SQL Performance Analyzer

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 8: SQL Plan Management

## Task 1: Create a tuning task

You use the SQL Tuning Set *STS_CaptureCursorCache* as input to the advisor. The SQL Tuning Set contains the workload you generated with HammerDB. SQL Tuning Advisor will look at each of the statements and come up with tuning suggestions.

1. Connect to the upgraded UPGR database.

      ```
      <copy>
      . cdb23
      sqlplus / as sysdba
      alter session set container=UPGR;
      </copy>

      -- Be sure to hit RETURN
      ```

2. Create a SQL Tuning Advisor task.

    ```
    <copy>
    @/home/oracle/scripts/sta_cc.sql
    </copy>
    ```

3. Optionally, you can look at the script to understand how you use the SQL Tuning Advisor API.

4. First, a few words about the SQL Tuning Advicor. 

    * The SQL Tuning Advisor provides many recommendations. Some are more useful than others. 
    * Generally, you need to use your knowledge of the application using the database to determine which recommendations to apply.
    * Do not blindly accept all recommendations made by the SQL Tuning Advisor.

5. Examine the output of SQL Tuning Advisor. Scroll to the top of the output. Your output may vary from the sample output below. Read and interpret your own report.

    * General information contains basic information on the SQL Tuning Advisor task. You can see it was created based on a SQL Tuning Set.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FINDINGS SECTION (2 findings)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    1- Index Finding (see explain plans section below)
    --------------------------------------------------
      The execution plan of this statement can be improved by creating one or more
      indices.
    
      Recommendation (estimated benefit: 97.77%)
      ------------------------------------------
      - Consider running the Access Advisor to improve the physical schema design
        or creating the recommended index.
        create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0001 on TPCC.CUSTOMER("C_LAST","C_D_ID","C_W_ID
        ");
    
      Rationale
      ---------
        Creating the recommended indices significantly improves the execution plan
        of this statement. However, it might be preferable to run "Access Advisor"
        using a representative SQL workload as opposed to a single statement. This
        will allow to get comprehensive index recommendations which takes into
        account index maintenance overhead and additional space consumption.
    
    2- Alternative Plan Finding
    ---------------------------
      Some alternative execution plans for this statement were found by searching
      the system's real-time and historical performance data.
    
      The following table lists these plans ranked by their average elapsed time.
      See section "ALTERNATIVE PLANS SECTION" for detailed information on each
      plan.
    
      id plan hash	last seen	     elapsed (s)  origin	  note
      -- ---------- -------------------- ------------ --------------- ----------------
       1  612465046  2024-06-03/07:02:38	    0.001 AWR		  original plan
       2 4040750106  2024-06-03/07:02:38	    0.041 AWR
    
      Information
      -----------
      - The Original Plan appears to have the best performance, based on the
        elapsed time per execution.  However, if you know that one alternative
        plan is better than the Original Plan, you can create a SQL plan baseline
        for it. This will instruct the Oracle optimizer to pick it over any other
        choices in the future.
        BEGIN
         dbms_sqltune.create_sql_plan_baseline(
          task_name => 'STA_UPGRADE_TO_23AI_CC',
          object_id => 5,
          owner_name => 'SYS',
          plan_hash_value => xxxxxxxx);
        END;
        /

    Schema Name   : TPCC
    Container Name: UPGR
    SQL ID	      : csv0xdm9c394t
    SQL Text      : SELECT O_ID, O_CARRIER_ID, O_ENTRY_D FROM (SELECT O_ID,
                    O_CARRIER_ID, O_ENTRY_D FROM ORDERS WHERE O_D_ID = :B3 AND
                    O_W_ID = :B2 AND O_C_ID=:B1 ORDER BY O_ID DESC) WHERE ROWNUM
                    = 1  
    ```
    </details>

    * In the end, there is a summary of the findings that you can use to implement all the recommendations.

    create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0001 on TPCC.CUSTOMER("C_LAST","C_D_ID","C_W_ID");
    create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0002 on TPCC.ORDERS("O_C_ID","O_D_ID","O_W_ID");
    create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0003 on TPCC.CUSTOMER("C_LAST","C_D_ID","C_W_ID");
    create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0003 on TPCC.CUSTOMER("C_LAST","C_D_ID","C_W_ID");
    ```
    </details>

## Task 2: Implement recommendations

In this lab, you will implement some of the recommendations. Namely, those about creating indexes. Then, you can use SQL Performance Analyzer to determine the impact.

1. Implement the index recommendation. Be sure to remove duplicate recommendations. Your recommendations may vary from the sample output. Copy/paste the recommendations from your own report.

    ```
    <copy>
    create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0001 on TPCC.CUSTOMER("C_LAST","C_D_ID","C_W_ID");
    create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0002 on TPCC.ORDERS("O_C_ID","O_D_ID","O_W_ID");
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0001 on TPCC.CUSTOMER("C_LAST","C_D_ID","C_W_ID");

    Index created.

    SQL> create index TPCC.IDX$$_02ED0002 on TPCC.ORDERS("O_C_ID","O_D_ID","O_W_ID");

    Index created.
    ```
    </details>

    * This is an exercise only. In a real environment, don't accept the recommendations without thorough consideration.
    * In this lab, the recommendations are to create indexes. Although the effect on your workload might be positive, remember that indexes also affect DMLs.

## Task 3: Validate recommendations using SQL Performance Analyzer

1. Evaluate the effect on your workload. Use SPA to test based on *ELAPSED\_TIME* and generate reports.

    ```
    <copy>
    @/home/oracle/scripts/spa_elapsed.sql
    @/home/oracle/scripts/spa_report_elapsed.sql
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Exit SQL*Plus

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

3. Examine the SQL Performance Analyzer report based on *ELAPSED\_TIME*.

    ```
    <copy>
    firefox $(ls -t compare_spa_runs*html | head -1) &
    </copy>
    ```

    * If you made additional SPA runs using the script, then the above command won't select the right report.

    ![Creating indexes give a better performance](./images/sqltune-spa1.png " ")

    * Overall there is almost a 3 % improvement from creating indexes.
    * This is based on the workload from the SQL Tuning Set. It does not tell anything about the effect on other workloads, like DMLs.

**Congratulations! You have completed the Performance Stability Prescription.**

This is the end of track 1. You can proceed with any lab from tracks 2 or 3. 

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
