# Upgrade Encrypted Non-CDB and Convert

## Introduction

This lab focuses on databases encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). You will upgrade an encrypted non-CDB to Oracle Database 23ai and convert it to a PDB. This requires the database keystore passwords for the non-CDB and CDB. For this purpose, AutoUpgrade has its own keystore which you will use.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Use the AutoUpgrade keystore
* Use the summary report to check keystore password requirements
* Upgrade and convert an encrypted database

### Prerequisites

None.

This lab uses the *FTEX* and *CDB23* databases. It also encrypts both databases which have an effect on the other labs. We recommend that you perform this lab as the last one.

## Task 1: Encrypt source non-CDB

Currently, the *FTEX* database is not encrypted. You must start by preparing the database for encryption, and by encrypting an existing tablespace.

1. Create a directory to hold the database keystore.

    ```
    <copy>
    mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/admin/FTEX/wallet/tde
    </copy>
    ```

2. Set the environment to the *FTEX* database and connect.

    ```
    <copy>
    . ftex
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

3. Configure the database to store its keystore in the directory you just created. It's a static parameter requiring a restart of the database.

    ```
    <copy>
    alter system set wallet_root='/u01/app/oracle/admin/FTEX/wallet' scope=spfile;
    shutdown immediate
    startup
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    Database opened.
    ```
    </details>

4. Configure the database to use a software keystore (in the directory specified in `WALLET_ROOT`).

    ```
    <copy>
    alter system set tde_configuration='keystore_configuration=file' scope=both;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> alter system set tde_configuration='keystore_configuration=file' scope=both;

    System altered.
    ```
    </details>

5. Create the keystore, open it, set a TDE master key and configure an auto-login keystore.

    ```
    <copy>
    administer key management create keystore '/u01/app/oracle/admin/FTEX/wallet/tde' identified by "oracle_4U";
    administer key management set keystore open force keystore identified by "oracle_4U";
    administer key management set key identified by "oracle_4U" with backup;
    administer key management create local auto_login keystore from keystore '/u01/app/oracle/admin/FTEX/wallet/tde' identified by "oracle_4U";
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>

    keystore altered.
    ```
    </details>

5. Encrypt the *USERS* tablespace. It is an online operation.

    ```
    <copy>
    alter tablespace users encryption encrypt;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> alter tablespace users encryption encrypt;

    Tablespace altered.
    ```
    </details>

6. Verify that the *USERS* tablespace is encrypted.

    ```
    <copy>
    select tablespace_name, encrypted from dba_tablespaces;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select tablespace_name, encrypted from dba_tablespaces;

    TABLESPACE_NAME                ENC
    ------------------------------ ---
    SYSTEM                          NO
    SYSAUX                          NO
    TEMP                            NO
    USERS                          YES
    UNDOTBS100                      NO
    ```
    </details>

7. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Encrypt target CDB

Currently, the *CDB23* database is not encrypted. You must start by preparing the database for encryption.

1. Create a directory to hold the database keystore.

    ```
    <copy>
    mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB23/wallet/tde
    </copy>
    ```

2. Set the environment to the *CDB23* database and connect.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

3. Configure the database to store its keystore in the directory you just created. It's a static parameter requiring a restart of the database.

    ```
    <copy>
    alter system set wallet_root='/u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB23/wallet' scope=spfile;
    shutdown immediate
    startup
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> alter system set wallet_root='/u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB23/wallet' scope=spfile;

    System altered.

    SQL> shutdown immediate

    Database closed.
    Database dismounted.
    ORACLE instance shut down.

    SQL> startup

    ORACLE instance started.

    Total System Global Area 4292413984 bytes
    Fixed Size                  5368352 bytes
    Variable Size            1157627904 bytes
    Database Buffers         3120562176 bytes
    Redo Buffers                8855552 bytes

    Database mounted.
    Database opened.
    ```
    </details>

4. Configure the database to use a software keystore (in the directory specified in `WALLET_ROOT`).

    ```
    <copy>
    alter system set tde_configuration='keystore_configuration=file' scope=both;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> alter system set tde_configuration='keystore_configuration=file' scope=both;

    System altered.
    ```
    </details>

5. Create the keystore, open it, set a TDE master key and configure an auto-login keystore.

    ```
    <copy>
    administer key management create keystore '/u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB23/wallet/tde' identified by "oracle_4U";
    administer key management set keystore open force keystore identified by "oracle_4U";
    administer key management set key identified by "oracle_4U" with backup;
    administer key management create local auto_login keystore from keystore '/u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB23/wallet/tde' identified by "oracle_4U";
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You use the same keystore password in *CDB23* as well for simplicity. Realistically, you would choose different keystore passwords.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> administer key management create keystore '/u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB23/wallet/tde' identified by "oracle_4U";

    keystore altered.
    ```
    </details>

6. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Analyze the database

Analyze the *FTEX* database for upgrade readiness.

1. To enable AutoUpgrade to work with encrypted databases, it must have access to a directory where it can store a special keystore just for AutoUpgrade.

    ```
    <copy>
    mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/keystore/autoupgrade
    </copy>
    ```

2. In this lab, you will use a pre-created AutoUpgrade config file. Examine the config file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/scripts/encrypted-db-upg-conv.cfg
    </copy>
    ```

    * The location for the AutoUpgrade keystore is defined by `global.keystore`.
    * `target_cdb` specified the CDB where you want to plug in the non-CDB specified by `sid`.
    * `target_pdb_name` renames the *FTEX* database on plug-in to *CYAN*.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    global.autoupg_log_dir=/home/oracle/logs/encrypted-db-upg-conv

    upg1.target_home=/u01/app/oracle/product/23
    upg1.sid=FTEX
    upg1.target_cdb=CDB23
    upg1.target_pdb_name.FTEX=CYAN
    ```
    </details>

3. Start AutoUpgrade in analyze mode. Wait for it to complete.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config /home/oracle/scripts/encrypted-db-upg-conv.cfg -mode analyze
    </copy>
    ```

    * Notice how AutoUpgrade starts by loading its keystore.
    * The keystore is found in the location defined by `global.keystore`.

5. You find additional details in the preupgrade log file. There is a *required action* that you must do before the upgrade.

    * You must load the database keystore password into the AutoUpgrade keystore for the databases *FTEX* and *CDB23*. 
    * AutoUpgrade must have access to keystore password to complete the process.
    * Optionally, you can check the entire preupgrade log file. It is in `/home/oracle/logs/encrypted-db-upg-conv/FTEX/100/prechecks/ftex_preupgrade.log`.

    ```
    (output truncated)

    ==============
    BEFORE UPGRADE
    ==============
    
      REQUIRED ACTIONS
      ================
      1.  Perform the specified action for each database in order to satisfy
          AutoUpgrade's TDE keystore requirements. This will involve adding the TDE
          keystore password for the database into either AutoUpgrade's keystore
          using the -load_password command line option or into a Secure External
          Password Store (SEPS) for the database. Once the upgrade has finished and
          there is no intention to use AutoUpgrade's system restore functionality
          to rerun the upgrade, the AutoUpgrade keystore file(s) can be removed
          from the directory or path referenced by the global.keystore
          configuration parameter.
    
          At this point, either (1) the TDE keystore password(s) required by
          AutoUpgrade have not been loaded into AutoUpgrade's keystore or a Secure
          External Password Store or (2) the auto-login keystore status of the
          database has not been modified. Review the required actions for each of
          the following databases:
    
          ORACLE_SID                      Action Required
          ------------------------------  ----------------------------------------
          CDB23                           Add TDE password
          FTEX                            Add TDE password
    
          For AutoUpgrade to upgrade a database using Oracle Transparent Data
          Encryption (TDE), the following conditions must be met:
    
          1. The TDE keystore password(s) required by AutoUpgrade must be loaded
          into AutoUpgrade's keystore or a Secure External Password Store for the
          database.
    
          When the source database uses TDE, AutoUpgrade requires TDE passwords for
          the databases listed below:
          * Both the source non-CDB and the target CDB of a non-CDB to PDB operation
          * Both the source CDB and the target CDB of an unplug-plug operation
          * Only the target CDB of an unplug-relocate operation
    
          2. The target CDB, if specified, must have an auto-login TDE keystore if
          its version is earlier than Oracle Database 19.11
    
          3. To upgrade a non-CDB or an entire CDB, the TDE keystore must be an
          auto-login keystore. This requirement also applies to a non-CDB to PDB
          operation, but only if the target CDB is at an Oracle Database Release
          earlier than 21c. If earlier than 21c, AutoUpgrade performs a standard
          upgrade of the non-CDB to the target version prior to creating the PDB in
          the target CDB.
    ```

6. Load the database keystore passwords into the AutoUpgrade keystore. Start the password loader.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config /home/oracle/scripts/encrypted-db-upg-conv.cfg -load_password
    </copy>
    ```

    * Since it is the first time you start the password loader, AutoUpgrade asks for a password to protect the AutoUpgrade keystore. This is not the database keystore password.
    * Use the following AutoUpgrade keystore password: *autoupgrade_4U*

    ```
    </details>

6. Switch to the *CYAN* PDB and ensure the *USERS* tablespace is still encrypted.


    ```
    <copy>
    alter session set container=CYAN;
    select tablespace_name, encrypted from dba_tablespaces;
    </copy>    
    
    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    Session altered.
    
    SQL> select tablespace_name, encrypted from dba_tablespaces;
    
    TABLESPACE_NAME                ENC
    ------------------------------ ---
    SYSTEM                         NO

    TEMP                           NO
    USERS                          YES
    UNDOTBS100                     NO    
    ```
    </details>

7. Verify that the PDB is using a keystore.

    ```
    <copy>
    col status format a10
    select wrl_type, status, wallet_type, keystore_mode from v$encryption_wallet;
    </copy>    
    
    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> col status format a10
    SQL> select wrl_type, status, wallet_type, keystore_mode from v$encryption_wallet;
    
    WRL_TYPE             STATUS     WALLET_TYPE          KEYSTORE
    -------------------- ---------- -------------------- --------
    FILE                 OPEN       PASSWORD             UNITED  
    ```
    </details>

8. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

**Congratulations!** You have now upgraded your encrypted database to Oracle Database 23ai.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.

Since encrypted databases are becoming more popular, it's important to know how to deal with them. AutoUpgrade fully supports any scenario when the database is encrypted, and you can safely store database keystore passwords in AutoUpgrade's keystore.

For fully automated solutions, you should explore Secure External Password Stores which enables upgrades and migration of encrypted databases even without loading the password into AutoUpgrade's keystore.
