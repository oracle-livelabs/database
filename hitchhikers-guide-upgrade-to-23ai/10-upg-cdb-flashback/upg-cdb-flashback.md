# Upgrade CDB and Roll Back Using Flashback Database

## Introduction

In this lab, you will upgrade an entire CDB including PDBs from Oracle Database 19c to 23ai. Then, you will practice a rollback and the restoration option in AutoUpgrade. This uses Flashback Database to get the database back to the starting point.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Upgrade entire CDB
* Restore CDB

### Prerequisites

None.

This lab uses the *CDB19* databases. Don't do this lab at the same time as lab 15.

## Task 1: Prepare your environment

You start by checking the *CDB19* database.

1. Set the environment to the *CDB19* database and connect.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb19
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Start up *CDB19*.

    ```
    <copy>
    startup
    </copy>
    ```

    * The *CDB19* database might be running already. If so, you will get `ORA-01081: cannot start already-running ORACLE - shut it down first`. You can safely ignore the error.

    ```
    </details>

2. Get a list of PDBs.

    ```
    <copy>
    show pdbs
    </copy>
    ```

    * There is one user-created PDBs in the CDB, *ORANGE*.
    * If you have already made lab 15 Downgrade a PDB, you will also see *YELLOW*.

    ``` text
    CON_ID     CON_NAME           OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED

             4 ORANGE             READ WRITE NO
     ```
    </details>

3. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

4. For this lab, you will use a pre-created config file. Examine the pre-created config file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/scripts/cdb19.cfg
    </copy>
    ```

    * `restoration=yes` ensures that AutoUpgrade creates a guaranteed restore point that you can use later on to roll back to. The default value is *yes* but it is shown here for clarity.

    upg1.sid=CDB19
    upg1.restoration=yes
    ```
    </details>

## Task 2: Analyze your database

It is best practice to first analyze your database for upgrade readiness. It is a lightweight, non-intrusive check that you can run on a live database.

1. Start AutoUpgrade in *analyze* mode. The check usually completes very fast. Wait for it to complete.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config /home/oracle/scripts/cdb19.cfg -mode analyze
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>

    ```
    </details>

3. AutoUpgrade prints the path to the summary report. Check it.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/logs/upg-cdb-flashback/cfgtoollogs/upgrade/auto/status/status.log
    </copy>

    ```
    </details>

    * The report states: *Check passed and no manual intervention needed*. AutoUpgrade found no severe issues that it couldn't fix automatically.

## Task 3: Upgrade your database

You determined that the database is ready to upgrade. Start AutoUpgrade in *deploy* mode. One command is all it takes to perform the upgrade - including all pre- and post-upgrade tasks.

1. Start AutoUpgrade in *deploy* mode to perform the upgrade. Notice you are re-using the same command, but this time `-mode` is set to `deploy`.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config /home/oracle/scripts/cdb19.cfg -mode deploy
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>

    upg>
    ```
    </details>

2. You are now in the AutoUpgrade console. The upgrade job is running in the background. Show a list of running jobs and set it to refresh automatically

    ```
    <copy>
    lsj -a 30
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    Total jobs 1

    The command lsj is running every 30 seconds. PRESS ENTER TO EXIT

    (output varies)
    ```
    </details>

3. Wait until the upgrade completes. Depending on the hardware, the upgrade will take about 35-45 minutes. Don't exit from the AutoUpgrade console. Leave it running.

4. Optionally, you can complete some of the labs from tracks 1 and 3. Check *Introduction* for details

5. When the upgrade completes, AutoUpgrade prints a message saying *Job 101 completed* and exits from the AutoUpgrade console.

    <details>

    ```
    </details>

## Task 4: Restore database using AutoUpgrade

The database is now running on Oracle Database 23ai. Suppose your tests find a critical error and you would like to go back to Oracle Database 19c. AutoUpgrade automatically created a guaranteed restore point, and you can use Flashback Database to go back to the starting point.

1. Set the environment to the new Oracle home and connect to the upgraded *CDB19* database.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    export ORACLE_SID=CDB19
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Verify that the database is on Oracle Database 23ai.

    ```
    <copy>
    select instance_name, version from v$instance;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select instance_name, version from v$instance;

    ---------------- -----------------
    CDB19            23.0.0.0.0
    ```
    </details>

3. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

4. AutoUpgrade also updated the *oratab* registration.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /etc/oratab | grep CDB19
    </copy>
    ```

    * Notice how the Oracle home is set to the new, 23ai Oracle home.
    * If Grid Infrastructure would manage the database, AutoUpgrade would modify the clusterware registration as well.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    CDB19:/u01/app/oracle/product/23:N
    ```
    </details>

5. Get the database back to the starting point; the guaranteed restore point that AutoUpgrade automatically created before the upgrade.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config /home/oracle/scripts/cdb19.cfg -restore -jobs 101
    </copy>
    ```

    * You start the restoration based on the *job ID*.
    * Job *101* was the job that upgraded the database.
    * If you had multiple jobs to restore, you can supply a comma-separated list.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text

    Total jobs being restored: 1
    +--------------------------------+
    | Starting AutoUpgrade execution |
    +--------------------------------+
    ```
    </details>

6. After a short while the restoration completes. It usually takes only a few minutes. AutoUpgrade uses Flashback Database which is a very effective mean of restoring the database. Then, it needs to open the database with `RESETLOGS` which can take a short while if the redo log members are big.

    </details>

7. Set the environment to the original Oracle home and connect.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb19
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

8. Verify that the database is running on Oracle Database 19c.

    ```
    <copy>
    select instance_name, version from v$instance;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>

    ```
    </details>

9. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

10. AutoUpgrade also reverted the *oratab* registration.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /etc/oratab | grep CDB19
    </copy>
    ```

    * Notice how the Oracle home is set to the original, 19c Oracle home.
    * If Grid Infrastructure would manage the database, AutoUpgrade would modify the clusterware registration as well.

11. AutoUpgrade also moved database configuration files back into the original Oracle home.

    ```
    <copy>
    ll $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/*CDB19*
    </copy>
    ```

    * AutoUpgrade also moves other configuration files like network files (`sqlnet.ora`, `tnsnames.ora`).

    ```
    </details>

**You have now restored the *CDB19* database.**

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.

## Learn More

AutoUpgrade completely automates restoration of a database. By default, AutoUpgrade creates a guaranteed restore point before making any changes to the database. If a critical error occurs during upgrade or if your post-upgrade test reveals an issue preventing go-live, you can use AutoUpgrade to bring the database back into the *before-upgrade* state.
