  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use the following format.

	> **Note:** _The filename must be in lowercase letters and CANNOT include any spaces._

  Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

	When the file type is recognized by the browser, it will attempt to render it. So you can use the following format to force the download dialog box.

	> **Note:** _The filename must be in lowercase letters and CANNOT include any spaces._

	Download the [sample JSON code](files/sample.json?download=1).

  *IMPORTANT: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
