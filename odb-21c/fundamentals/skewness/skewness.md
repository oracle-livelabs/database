# Measure Asymmetry in Data with the SKEWNESS Functions

## Introduction

This lab shows how to use the `SKEWNESS_POP` and `SKEWNESS_SAMP` aggregate functions to measure asymmetry in data. For a given set of values, the result of population skewness (`SKEWNESS_POP`) and sample skewness (`SKEWNESS_SAMP`) are always deterministic.

### About Data Skewness

When you approach the distribution of data for the first time, it’s often helpful to pull out summary statistics to understand the domain of the data.

Mean and variance are certainly helpful for understanding the scope of a dataset, but to understand the shape of the data we often turn to generating the histogram and manually evaluating the curve of the distribution.

Two additional summary statistics, skew and kurtosis, are a good next step for evaluating the shape of a distribution. ​We will explore skewness in this lab.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

## Task 1: Login to SQL Developer Web on Oracle Autonomous Database

There are multiple ways to access your Autonomous Database.  You can access it via SQL\*Plus or by using SQL Developer Web.  To access it via SQL\*Plus, skip to [Step 1B](#STEP1B:LogintoADBusingSQLPlus).

1.  If you aren't still logged in, login to your Oracle Autonomous Database screen by clicking on the navigation menu and selecting the Autonomous Database flavor you selected (Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing, Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, or Oracle Autonomous JSON Database). Otherwise skip to the next step.
      ![](../set-operators/images/21c-home-adb.png " ")

2.  If you can't find your Oracle Autonomous Database instance, ensure you are in the correct compartment, you have chosen the flavor of Oracle Autonomous Database you choose in the earlier lab and that you are in the correct region.

3.  Click on the **Display Name** to go to your Oracle Autonomous Database main page.
      ![](../set-operators/images/21c-adb.png " ")

4.  Click on the **Tools** tab, select **Database Actions**, a new browser will open up.
      ![](../set-operators/images/tools.png " ")

5.  Enter the username *report* and password *WElcome123##*

6.  Click on the **SQL** button.

## Task 1B: Login to Oracle Autonomous Database using SQL Plus
1. If you aren't logged into the cloud, log back in
2. Open up Cloud Shell
3. Connect to the *REPORT* user using SQL\*Plus by entering the commands below.

   ```
    export TNS_ADMIN=$(pwd)/wallet
    sqlplus /nolog
    conn report/WElcome123##@adb1_high
     ```
</if>

## Task 2: Examine skewed data
<if type="dbcs">
1.  Make some modifications to the display

   ```
   SQL> <copy>SET PAGES 100</copy>
   ```

</if>
<if type="atp">
1.  If you aren't logged in to SQL Developer Web, login as the *REPORT* user.

</if>
2. Display the table rows. The `HOUSE` column values refer to types of house that you want to look at and categorize the data that you look at statistically and compare with each other. With Skewness, you measure whether there is more data towards the left or the right end of the tail (positive/negative) or how close you are to a normal distribution (skewness = 0).

   ```
   SQL> <copy>SELECT * FROM houses;</copy>
   ```

3. Display the result of population skewness prices (`SKEWNESS_POP`) and sample skewness prices (`SKEWNESS_SAMP`) for the three houses in the table.

  *Skewness is important in a situation where `PRICE_BIG_CITY` and `PRICE_SMALL_CITY` represent the prices of houses to buy and you want to determine whether the outliers in data are biased towards the left end or right end of the distribution, that is, if there are more values to the left of the mean when compared to the number of values to the right of the mean.*

## Task 3: Examine skewed data after data evolution

<if type="dbcs">
1. Insert more rows in the table.

   ```
   SQL> <copy>INSERT INTO houses SELECT * FROM houses;</copy>
   19 rows created.

   SQL> <copy>/</copy>

<if type="atp">
1. Insert more rows in the table.

  ```

2. Press the play button in SQL Developer Web to submit.

3. Press the play button 3 more times to submit a total of 152 rows.

</if>

2. Explore the skewness after the data has changed.

  ```
  SQL> <copy>SELECT house, SKEWNESS_POP(price_big_city), SKEWNESS_POP(price_small_city) FROM houses
  GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>
  ```
  <if type="dbcs">

   ```
  </if>

  <if type="atp">
  ![](./images/step3-4.png " ")
  </if>

  *As the number of values in the data set increases, the difference between the computed values of `SKEWNESS_SAMP` and `SKEWNESS_POP` decreases.*

2. Determine the skewness of distinct values in columns `PRICE_BIG_CITY` and `PRICE_SMALL_CITY`.

   ```
   SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
   SKEWNESS_POP(DISTINCT price_big_city) pop_big_city,
   SKEWNESS_SAMP(DISTINCT price_big_city) samp_big_city,
   SKEWNESS_POP(DISTINCT price_small_city) pop_small_city,
   SKEWNESS_SAMP(DISTINCT price_small_city) samp_small_city  
   FROM houses
   GROUP BY house;</copy>
   ```
  <if type="atp">
  ![](./images/step3-5a.png " ")
  </if>

  <if type="dbcs">
   ```
   HOUSE POP_BIG_CITY SAMP_BIG_CITY POP_SMALL_CITY SAMP_SMALL_CITY
   ---------- ------------ ------------- -------------- ---------------
   1            0             0     -.66864012      -.81051422
   2   1.13841996    1.69705627     1.49637083      2.23065793

   ```
  </if>

  Is the result much different if the query does not evaluate the distinct values in columns `PRICE_BIG_CITY` and `PRICE_SMALL_CITY`?

   ```
   SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
   SKEWNESS_POP(price_big_city) pop_big_city,
   SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_big_city) samp_big_city,
   SKEWNESS_POP(price_small_city) pop_small_city,
   SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_small_city) samp_small_city

   GROUP BY house;</copy>

  </if>

  <if type="dbcs">

   ```
   </if>

  The population skewness value is not different because the same exact rows were inserted.

<if type="atp">
3. Insert more rows in the table with a big data set for `HOUSE` number 1.
