# Enforcing Unified Audit Policies on the Current User

## Introduction

This lab shows how unified audit policies are enforced on the current user who executes the SQL statement.

Estimated Lab Time: 2 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a DBCS VM Database
* Lab: 21c Setup

## Task 1: Create the users and a procedure

1. Connect to `PDB21` as `SYSTEM` and verify which predefined unified audit policies are implemented.

  
	```
	
	$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/labs/M104781GC10</copy>
	
	$ <copy>/home/oracle/labs/M104781GC10/setup_audit_policies.sh</copy>
	
	...	
	Connected to:	
	Oracle Database 21c Enterprise Edition Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production	
	Version 21.2.0.0.0
	
	SQL> drop user u1 cascade;	
	drop user u1 cascade	
				*	
	ERROR at line 1:	
	ORA-01918: user 'U1' does not exist
	
	SQL> drop user u2 cascade;	
	drop user u2 cascade
	
				*
	
	ERROR at line 1:	
	ORA-01918: user 'U2' does not exist
	
	SQL> create user u1 identified by password;	
	User created.
	
	SQL> grant create session, create procedure to u1;	
	Grant succeeded.
	
	SQL> create user u2 identified by password;	
	User created.
	
	SQL> grant select on hr.employees to u1, u2;	
	Grant succeeded.
	
	SQL> grant create session to u2;	
	Grant succeeded.
	
	SQL> grant select on unified_audit_trail to u1,u2;	
	Grant succeeded.
	
	SQL>
	
	SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE u1.procemp (employee_id IN NUMBER)	
		2  AS	
		3     v_emp_id  NUMBER:=employee_id;	
		4     v_sal NUMBER;
	
		5  BEGIN	
		6     SELECT salary INTO v_sal FROM hr.employees WHERE employee_id=v_emp_id;	
		7     dbms_output.put_line('Salary is : '||v_sal || ' for Employee ID: '||v_emp_id);	
		8  END procemp;
	
		9  /
	
	Procedure created.	
	SQL>
	
	SQL> grant execute on u1.procemp to u2;	
	Grant succeeded.
	
	SQL>	
	SQL> exit
	
	$
	
	```

## Task 2: Create and enable an audit policy 

1. In `PDB21`, create and enable an audit policy so as to audit any query on `HR.EMPLOYEES` table executed by the login user `U2`.

  
	```
	
	$ <copy>sqlplus system@PDB21</copy>	
	Copyright (c) 1982, 2019, Oracle.  All rights reserved.
	
	Enter password: <i><copy>password</copy></i>
	Oracle Database 21c Enterprise Edition Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production	
	Version 21.2.0.0.0
	
	SQL> <copy>CREATE AUDIT POLICY pol_emp ACTIONS select on hr.employees;</copy>	
	Audit policy created.
	
	SQL> <copy>AUDIT POLICY pol_emp BY u2;</copy>	
	Audit succeeded.
	
	SQL> 
	
	```

## Task 3: Test

1. Connect to `PDB21` as the user `U2` and execute the `U1.PROCEMP` procedure.

  
	```
	
	SQL> <copy>CONNECT u2@PDB21</copy>	
	Enter password: <i><copy>password</copy></i>	
	SQL> <copy>SET SERVEROUTPUT ON</copy>	
	SQL> <copy>EXECUTE u1.procemp(206)</copy>
	
	Salary is : 8300 for Employee ID: 206
	
	PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.	
	SQL> 
	
	```

2. Display the `DBUSERNAME` (the login user) and the `CURRENT_USER` being the user who executed the procedure from the unified audit trail.

  
	```
	
	SQL> <copy>SELECT dbusername, current_user, action_name	
		FROM   unified_audit_trail	
		WHERE  unified_audit_policies = 'POL_EMP';</copy>
	
	no rows selected
	
	SQL> <copy>EXIT</copy>
	
	$
	
	```
  
  *Observe that the unified audit policy is enforced on the current user who executed the SQL statement, `U1`. Because only `U2` is audited and `U1` is the current user executing the query, there is no audit record generated that would give to the auditor the impression that the statement is executed by the user who owned the top-level user session.*
  
You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
