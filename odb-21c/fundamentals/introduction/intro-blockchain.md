# Introduction

This workshop highlights enhancements to Oracle Database security, including Blockchain tables.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes

## Blockchain Tables in Oracle Database 21c
Blockchain tables are append-only tables in which only insert operations are allowed. Deleting rows is either prohibited or restricted based on time. Rows in a blockchain table are made tamper-resistant by special sequencing & chaining algorithms. Users can verify that rows have not been tampered. A hash value that is part of the row metadata is used to chain and validate rows.

Blockchain tables enable you to implement a centralized ledger model where all participants in the blockchain network have access to the same tamper-resistant ledger.

A centralized ledger model reduces administrative overheads of setting a up a decentralized ledger network, leads to a relatively lower latency compared to decentralized ledgers, enhances developer productivity, reduces the time to market, and leads to significant savings for the organization. Database users can continue to use the same tools and practices that they would use for other database application development.
