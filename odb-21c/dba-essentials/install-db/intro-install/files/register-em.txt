If you register with Oracle Enterprise Manager, then you can manage your database in a web browser from the EM console. To register with EM, you require some details, such as OMS host name, port number, and the EM administrative credentials.
However, instead of registering from this window, you can use the discovery process in EM and add your Oracle Database as a managed target.
