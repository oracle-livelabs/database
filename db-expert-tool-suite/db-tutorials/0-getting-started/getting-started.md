## Task 2: Overview of DB Expert

### Oracle DBExpert – an AI-powered expert resource web application ###

Oracle offers a comprehensive portfolio of database services, available to deploy in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, in your location with Cloud@Customer, and in multi-cloud environments such as Oracle Database@Azure.   Choosing the best solution for your new deployment or migration project may involve many business and technical considerations, and collecting and evaluating all the information you need is not always a simple task.

As with many undertakings, the first step is often the hardest.  Where to start?  To assist you in taking the first step with a structured and guided discovery and evaluation process, our team created https://www.oracle.com/dbexpert, providing up-to-date, curated information covering Oracle's Database Management cloud services offerings.

The site’s main tools include:
- Information Viewers - quickly explore Oracle cloud service and database capabilities
- Advisors - enter your requirements and instantly see recommendations and estimated pricing
- Downloadable tools - analyze and report on your current Oracle estate
- REST API endpoints - information retrieval and exercise the advisors

The information viewers facilitate browsing and searching, while the advisors are user-driven interfaces that take inputs in pre-defined formats, such as select lists, radio buttons, and checkboxes, and provide appropriate guidance. These user experiences greatly simplify the process of selecting a service and deployment model.
