## Introduction

### Accelerate your Oracle Database Estate Migration to the Cloud

[Oracle Estate Explorer](https://www.oracle.com/database/cloud-migration/estate-explorer/) is a free analysis tool that reveals operational and ownership insights, TCO alternatives, and migration readiness across your Oracle Database estate. Use it to compare TCO between on-premises and cloud databases and to accelerate migrations to Autonomous Database.


**Estimated Time: 10 minutes**
