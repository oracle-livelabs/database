# Checksum and Encryption

## Introduction

When you move complex data around or when you're doing full exports/imports, it's common to find errors in the Data Pump log file. In this lab, you will learn about errors and how to determine whether an import was successful. 

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Examine errors and log files
* Compare schemas

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 7: Checksum and Encryption

## Task 1: Errors

During export and import, Data Pump may face errors or situations that can't be resolved.

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. If Data Pump encounters an error or faces a situation it can't resolve, it will print an error to the console and into the logfile. At the end of the output, Data Pump summarizes and lists the number of errors faced during the job. Examine the last lines of a Data Pump import log file.

    ```
    <copy>
    tail -4 /home/oracle/scripts/dp-08-errors-import.log
    </copy>
    ```

    * The last line says *completed with 1 error*.
    * You need to examine the entire log file if you want to find the details.

    </details> 

2. In a Data Pump import, you experience the following error. What do you think about it?

    ```
    01-MAY-25 08:05:02.836: W-1 Processing object type SCHEMA_EXPORT/TABLE/TABLE
    01-MAY-25 08:05:03.845: ORA-39117: Type needed to create table is not included in this operation. Failing sql is:

    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the answer*</summary>
    ``` text
    Data Pump fails to import an entire table. This is a critical situation that require thorough investigation. The data type used by the column "EMBEDDING" does not exist in this version. Mostly like you're importing in a lower release. If you're doing a database migration, such errors would probably warrent a full rollback.
    ```
    </details> 

3. In a Data Pump import, you experience the following error. What do you think about it?

    ```
    ORA-31693: Table data object "APPUSER"."TAB1" failed to load/unload and is being skipped due to error:
    ORA-02354: error in exporting/importing data
    ORA-01555: snapshot too old: rollback segment number 25 with name "_SYSSMU25_1608416701$" too small
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the answer*</summary>
    ``` text
    Data Pump faced an error while loading the rows due to the famous "ORA-01555: snapshot too old". If that was the only error in the import log file, you could try to load just the missing rows by telling Data Pump to include just that table (INCLUDE=TABLE:"IN('TAB1')") and start by truncating it (TABLE_EXIST_ACTION=TRUNCATE) and load just the rows (CONTENT=DATA_ONLY). 
    ```
    </details> 

4. In a Data Pump import, you experience the following error. What do you think about it?

    ```
    Processing object type DATABASE_EXPORT/SCHEMA/TABLE/INDEX/INDEX
    ORA-31684: Object type INDEX:"APPUSER"."TAB1_PK" already exists
    ORA-39083: Object type INDEX:"APPUSER"."TAB1_COL2_COL3_IDX" failed to create with error:
    ORA-01408: such column list already indexed
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the answer*</summary>
    ``` text
    First, you should determine the cause for some objects to exist already. Are you importing into a "contaminated" database? Were you expecting a comletely new, empty database? For the first index that already exist, check which columns are indexed. If it is the same columns, you coulde decide to ignore the error. You could use "impdp ... include=index sqlfile=idx.sql" to find the defintion of the index in the dump file. The other index fails because those columns are already indexed; you could also decide to ignore the error.
    ```
    </details> 

5. In a Data Pump import, you experience the following error. What do you think about it?

    ```
    Processing object type DATABASE_EXPORT/TABLESPACE
    ORA-39083: Object type TABLESPACE:"TS1" failed to create with error:
    ORA-01119: error in creating database file '/u03/app/oracle/oradata/DB1/ts1_01.dbf'
    ORA-27040: file create error, unable to create file
    OSD-04002: unable to open file
    O/S-Error: (OS 3) The system cannot find the path specified.
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the answer*</summary>
    ``` text
    The database can't create the tablespace because one or more of the data file specifications are incorrect. Perhaps the new host doesn't have the same mount points or disk groups. Try using "REMAP_DATAFILE" to create the data files in the correct directories. Most likely, this error would lead to other errors. If the tablespace is missing, tables and indexes will fail too. So, correct this error first and then retry the import.
    ```
    </details> 

6. In a Data Pump import, you experience the following error. What do you think about it?

    ```
    Processing object type TABLE_EXPORT/TABLE/STATISTICS/TABLE_STATISTICS
    Processing object type TABLE_EXPORT/TABLE/STATISTICS/MARKER
    ORA-39126: Worker unexpected fatal error in KUPW$WORKER.STATS_LOAD [MARKER] MARKER
    ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_SYS_ERROR", line 105
    ORA-06512: at "SYS.KUPW$WORKER", line 11265
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the answer*</summary>
    ``` text
    Data Pump fails to load the statistics. If this is the only error in the import, you can simply re-gather statistics or transport statistics separately using "DBMS_STATS". It might still be worth to investigate the problem, but it shouldn't prevent you from moving on.
    ```
    </details> 

7. These are just examples of the errors you might encounter. In each situation, you must investigate the situation and determine whether or not it influences the integrity of the data you're moving.


## Task 2: Comparing source and target

After moving data you can perform simple checks to validate the outcome. You will try such on the *F1* schema in the *RED* PDB that you imported in lab 7. 

1. Still in the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Connect to the *RED* PDB. This is our target database.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    sqlplus system/oracle@localhost/red
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The *RED* PDB contains an *F1* schema moved from the *FTEX* database.

2. Establish a database link back to the source database, *FTEX*. 

    ```
    <copy>
    create database link srclink connect to system identified by oracle using 'localhost/ftex';
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> create database link srclink connect to system identified by oracle using 'localhost/ftex';

    Database link SRCLINK created.
    ```
    </details> 

3. Count the number of objects grouped by types in the target database and compare it to the source database.

    ```
    <copy>
    select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects where owner='F1' group by object_type
    minus
    select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects@srclink where owner='F1' group by object_type;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * *No rows selected* means the count of different object types matches.
    * It does not mean that there are no differences between the source and target. 
    * This is just a simple count.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects where owner='F1' group by object_type
         minus
         select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects@srclink where owner='F1' group by object_type;
    
    no rows selected
    ```
    </details>

4. Drop a table in the target to simulate that one table was lost in the migration.

    ```
    <copy>
    drop table f1.f1_drivers purge;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> drop table f1.f1_drivers purge;
    
    Table dropped.
    ```
    </details>

5. Compare again.    

    ```
    <copy>
    select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects where owner='F1' group by object_type
    minus
    select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects@srclink where owner='F1' group by object_type;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The count of tables and indexes are different in the target compared to the source.
    
    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects where owner='F1' group by object_type
         minus
         select object_type, count(*) from dba_objects@srclink where owner='F1' group by object_type;    
    
    OBJECT_TYPE               COUNT(*)
    ----------------------- ----------
    TABLE                           13
    INDEX                           17
    ```
    </details>

6. Find out which table is missing.

    ```
    <copy>
    select table_name from dba_tables@srclink where owner='F1'
    minus
    select table_name from dba_tables where owner='F1';
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The query selects all the tables from the source and removes all the table from the target.
    * It shows that *F1\_DRIVERS* are missing. It is the table you just dropped.
    
    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text  
    TABLE_NAME
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    F1_DRIVERS
    ```
    </details>

7. If you want to compare the amount of rows, you can do that too

    ```
    <copy>
    select 
       (select count(*) from f1.f1_laptimes@srclink) as source,
       (select /*+parallel*/ count(*) from f1.f1_laptimes) as target
    from dual;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You can use parallel query to speed up the process, however, selects over a database link can't use parallel query.
    * For big tables it might be faster to run the query on each database, spool to a file and compare the two files.
    * Counting rows works most efficiently if the table has an index on a column with a NOT NULL constraint, like a primary key index.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text  
    SOURCE     TARGET
    ---------- ----------
    571047     571047
    ```
    </details>

8. The examples used in this task are not a complete guide. It should give you an idea of how you can use the data dictionary information and queries to compare your source and target environments. Comparing objects becomes more complicated when you have system-generated names for indexes and partitions and when you use Advanced Queueing. The latter because it creates a varying number of objects recursively depending on how you use the queues.


## Task 3: DBMS_COMPARISON

The `DBMS_COMPARISON` package allows you to compare the rows of the same table in two different databases. 

1. Still in the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨ and connected to the *RED* PDB from the previous task. Make a change to one of the tables in the local, or target, database.

    ```
    <copy>
    update f1.f1_constructors set name=name||'##42##' where name='Haas F1 Team';
    commit;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The update appends *##42##* to the name of *Hass F1 Team*. 

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> update f1.f1_constructors set name=name||'##42##' where name='Haas F1 Team';
    
    1 row updated.
    
    SQL> commit;
    
    Commit complete.
    ```
    </details> 

2. Create a new comparison.

    ```
    <copy>
    begin
        dbms_comparison.create_comparison (
            comparison_name => 'AFTER_MIGRATION',
            schema_name => 'F1',
            object_name => 'F1_CONSTRUCTORS',
            dblink_name => 'SRCLINK',
            scan_mode => DBMS_COMPARISON.CMP_SCAN_MODE_FULL);
    end;
    /
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The `SCAN_MODE` is set to full because it is a small table.
    * If you have bigger tables, you can select just a sample.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> begin
            dbms_comparison.create_comparison (
                comparison_name => 'AFTER_MIGRATION',
                schema_name => 'F1',
                object_name => 'F1_CONSTRUCTORS',
                dblink_name => 'SRCLINK',
                scan_mode => DBMS_COMPARISON.CMP_SCAN_MODE_FULL);
        end;
        /  2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
    
    PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
    
    SQL>    
    ```
    </details> 

3. Execute the comparison, list the number of differences and the query to find the rows.

    ```
    <copy>
    set line 150
    set serveroutput on

    col constructorref format a14
    col name format a30
    col nationality format a20
    col url format a50

    declare
        l_scan_info     dbms_comparison.comparison_type;
        l_outcome       boolean;
        l_count         number;
        l_diff          number;
        l_localrowid    user_comparison_row_dif.local_rowid%type;
        l_remoterowid   user_comparison_row_dif.remote_rowid%type;
        l_scanid        user_comparison_row_dif.scan_id%type;
    begin
        l_outcome := dbms_comparison.compare (
            comparison_name => 'AFTER_MIGRATION',
            scan_info       => l_scan_info,
            perform_row_dif => true);

        if l_outcome then
            dbms_output.put_line('No differences found!');
            return;
        end if;

        dbms_output.put_line('Differences found!');
    
        select current_dif_count, count_rows into l_diff, l_count from user_comparison_scan_summary where scan_id = l_scan_info.scan_id;

        dbms_output.put_line('Total rows: ' || l_count);
        dbms_output.put_line('Diff rows:  ' || l_diff);

        select   local_rowid, remote_rowid, max(scan_id) 
        into     l_localrowid, l_remoterowid, l_scanid
        from     user_comparison_row_dif 
        where    comparison_name='AFTER_MIGRATION' 
        group by local_rowid, remote_rowid;

        dbms_output.put_line('Local row:  select * from f1.f1_constructors where rowid='''|| l_localrowid || ''';');
        dbms_output.put_line('Remote row: select * from f1.f1_constructors@srclink where rowid='''|| l_remoterowid || ''';');

    end;
    /
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * For simplicity, the bits and pieces have been glued together in a piece of PL/SQL.
    * The code conducts a comparison and reports the differences.
    * It also lists a query to find the offending rows in the remote/source and local/target databases.
    * In this case, the comparison correctly finds the one row you changed previously. 

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    Differences found!
    Total rows: 212
    Diff rows:  1
    Local row:  select * from f1.f1_constructors where rowid='AAAG3lAAAAAAAPuAAW';
    Remote row: select * from f1.f1_constructors@srclink where rowid='AAAF6aAAEAAAAFkAAX';
    
    PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.    
    ```
    </details> 

4. Execute the two queries. Don't copy and paste from the instructions. Use the queries in your output.

    ```
    select * from f1.f1_constructors where rowid='AAAG3lAAAAAAAPuAAW';
    select * from f1.f1_constructors@srclink where rowid='AAAF6aAAEAAAAFkAAX';
    ```

    * Spot the difference. 
    * The name from the local - or target - database has *##42##* appended.
    * If you get `ORA-01410: invalid ROWID` or `ORA-01410: The ROWID is invalid.` you are using the wrong queries. Don't copy/paste from the instructions. Use the queries generated by your output.
