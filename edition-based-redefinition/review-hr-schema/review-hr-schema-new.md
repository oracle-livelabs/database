### Objectives

In this lab, you will

- Learn how to recognize the edition of an object and review the helper procedures that we have created in the previous lab.

## Task 1: Review the helper procedures created to deal with the editions

1. In a production environment, the management of editions is usually a DBA task.

    Some operations like `CREATE EDITION`, `DROP EDITION`, `ALTER DATABASE DEFAULT EDITION`, etc., require elevated privileges that should not be granted to normal users.

    By default, all procedures are considered definer's rights. You can designate a procedure to be an invoker's rights procedure by using the AUTHID CURRENT_USER clause when you create or modify it, or you can use the AUTHID DEFINER clause to make it a definer's rights procedure.

    For CI/CD testing, and therefore for production environments that rolled out with CI/CD pipelines, these procedures using `AUTHID DEFINER` will facilitate the integration without executing anything as DBA.

    Keep in mind, editions are shared among all schemas in the database, therefore all the schemas must belong to the same application and follow the same edition scheme. Different applications should be separated into different databases (or PDBs).

    The file `hr_main.sql` that we used to create the HR schema in the previous lab, creates the following procedures to let users manage and use editions themselves. Open the script *hr_main.sql* to review the contents.

    ![Create edition](images/create-edition.png " ")

    ![Drop edition](images/drop-edition.png " ")

    ![Default edition](images/default-edition.png " ")


2. In a normal situation, either a DBA or a single administrative user would take care of the editions, but in a development database or fully CI/  CD automated environment, developers may want to maintain the editions themselves. The `CREATE ANY EDITION` privilege is also handy, but not effective when the users that create them are recreated as part of integration tests: an edition is an object at the database (PDB) level, but the grants work like for normal objects (grants are lost if the grantor is deleted).

    The file `hr_main.sql` gives the extra grants to the `HR` user:

    ![HR grants](images/hr-grants.png " ")


## Task 2: Review the Base Tables and Editioning Views

1. The set of scripts that install the `HR` schema is different from the one that is usually shipped with the Oracle Database examples.

    Look at the file `hr_cre.sql`. This script is available in the initial_setup folder. Each table has a different name compared to the original `HR` schema (a suffix `$0` in this example):

    ![Create table region ](images/create-table-region.png " ")

    Each table has a corresponding *editioning view* that covers the table one to one:

    ![Edition view region](images/edition-view-region.png " ")

2. To verify this, connect with the `HR` user in SQLcl (if you got disconnected from sqlcl, refer to the Lab *Connect to ATP database and prepare the HR schema*, Task 1, for setting up the DB wallet)

    ```text
     <copy>connect hr/Welcome#Welcome#123@ebronline_medium</copy>
    ```

    **Replace `ebronline_medium` with your connection string. You must have noted down your connect strings in Lab 2.**

    Then use the SQLcl command `ddl regions` and you should able to see DDL of the regions view as below:

    ![DDL edition region](images/ddl-edition-region.png " ")

    The views, and all the depending objects, are editioned and belong to the `ORA$BASE` edition. This is the default edition when a database is created. Verify with the following SQL in the HR schema.

    ```text
    <copy>select OBJECT_NAME, OBJECT_TYPE, EDITION_NAME from user_objects_ae WHERE edition_name is not null  order by 2,3;</copy>
    ```

    ![Select base objects](images/select-base-objects.png " ")

You have successfully reviewed the HR schema. [Proceed to the next lab](#next) to start working with Liquibase and SQLcl.
