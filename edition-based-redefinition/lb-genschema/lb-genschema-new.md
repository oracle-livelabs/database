# Use Liquibase to generate the base schema

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Liquibase to generate the base changelog of the HR Schema.

Liquibase is an open-source database-independent library for tracking, managing and applying database schema changes.

In SQLcl, you can now execute commands to generate a changelog for a single object or for a full schema (changeset and changelogs). You can process these objects manually using SQLcl or through any of the traditional Liquibase interfaces.

With the Liquibase feature in SQLcl, you can:

- Generate and execute single object changelogs
- Generate and execute schema changesets with object dependencies
- Automatically sort a changeset during creation based on object dependencies
- Record all SQL statements for changeset or changelog execution, as it is generated
- Provide full rollback support for changesets and changelogs automatically

Estimated lab time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will

- Learn how to use Liquibase to generate the base changelog of the HR Schema.

## Task 1: Run lb generate-schema to generate the base changelog

1. The command `lb generate-schema` creates the base Liquibase changelog. 

    ![Cloud Shell home](images/cloudshell-home.png " ")

    The folder will be different in your environment.Verify that the current working directory is your home directory.

    ```text
    <copy>cd ~</copy>
    <copy>sql /nolog</copy>
    ```

2. Connect to the HR schema. **Replace `ebronline_medium` with your connection string. You must have noted down your connect strings in Lab 2.**

    ```text
    <copy>set cloudconfig ebronline.zip</copy>
    <copy>connect hr/Welcome#Welcome#123@ebronline_medium</copy>
    <copy>show user</copy>
    <copy>pwd</copy>
    ```

    ![sqlcl-hr](images/sqlcl-hr.png " ")

3. Make sure to run the lb generate-schema command from the directory ***changes/hr.00000.base***.

   Change the working directory to ***changes/hr.00000.base***, remove any existing files and run lb generate-schema

    ```text
    <copy>cd changes/hr.00000.base</copy>
    <copy>! rm -rf *.*</copy>
    <copy>lb generate-schema</copy>
    ```

    ![lb-genschema](images/lb-genschema.png " ")

    This initial changelog is useful if you plan to recreate the schema from scratch on a new environment by using `Liquibase`  instead of the `hr_main.sql` scripts.
    Notice that the `HR` schema creation is not included in the changelog.

4. The Liquibase changelog is created as a set of XML files. Exit from the SQLcl prompt and verify the generated XML files (check the file timestamp)

    ```text
    <copy>exit</copy>
    <copy>cd changes/hr.00000.base</copy>
    <copy>ls -ltr</copy>
    ```

    ![list schemaxml](images/list-schemaxml.png " ")

    The `controller.xml` is the changelog file that contains the changesets. Open it and note that changesets are called from the current path 

    ![controller Path](images/controller-path.png " ")

You have successfully generated the changelog for the HR schema using Liquibase. [Proceed to the next lab](#next) to modify the directory structure and sync the metadata.
