It takes 10-15 minutes just to get ready for a conversation.\n\n*\"Give me a complete picture of Acme Industries\"* seems like a simple request, but it requires checking three different systems. The loan officers want an assistant that can gather all this information automatically.\n\n### What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lab, you'll see how agents *plan* before they act. When you ask for a \"complete picture\" of a client, the agent:\n\n1. Analyzes what information is needed\n2. Identifies which tools can provide that information\n3. Determines the optimal order to call them\n4. Executes the plan and synthesizes the results\n\nThis planning capability is what makes agents predictable and debuggable. You can see exactly what the agent decided to do before it does it.\n\n**What you'll build:** A multi-tool agent that plans and coordinates client information retrieval.\n\n**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes",
