It's tedious. It's slow. And it takes time away from actually helping clients.\n\nThe company tried deploying a chatbot. But when a client asked \"What's the status of my loan application?\", the chatbot responded with a 5-step tutorial on how to log in and check. The client didn't want a tutorial. They wanted their status.\n\n> *\"I asked the AI about my loan and it told me how to look it up. I know how to look it up! I wanted you to just tell me the status.\"*\n\n### What You'll Learn\n\nThis lab shows you the fundamental difference between a chatbot (explains how) and an agent (actually does it). You'll build an agent that queries real loan data and returns actual answers.\n\n**What you'll build:** A loan application lookup agent with a SQL tool that queries your database.\n\n**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes",
