A $25,000 personal loan for someone with excellent credit should take minutes, not hours. But without smart routing, every application goes through the same manual review process.\n\n*\"Small loans take as long to process as big ones. We spend hours reviewing applications that should just auto-approve.\"*\n\nMeanwhile, the high-risk applications that actually need scrutiny get the same attention as routine ones. Senior underwriters waste time on $30K personal loans while $500K mortgages wait in queue.\n\n### What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lab, you'll build Seer Equity's risk assessment workflow. The agent will:\n\n1. Create loan applications with proper tracking IDs\n2. Assess risk based on loan type and amount\n3. Route appropriately:\n   - **Under $50K personal/auto** → Auto-approve (low risk)\n   - **$50K-$250K** → Underwriter review\n   - **Over $250K or mortgages** → Senior underwriter\n4. Log every step for audit compliance\n\nEvery agent follows the same pattern: **understand → plan → execute tools → analyze results → respond**. You'll trace this loop with detailed logging.\n\n**What you'll build:** A loan risk assessment workflow with conditional routing and audit trail.\n\n**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes",
