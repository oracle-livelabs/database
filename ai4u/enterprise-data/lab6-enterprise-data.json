I almost quoted wrong rates to a client!\"*\n\n*\"The AI doesn't know our policies. It gives generic answers about 'typical lending practices' when clients need our specific requirements.\"*\n\nWithout access to enterprise data, AI assistants are worse than useless. They're confidently wrong.\n\n### What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lab, you'll see the transformation that happens when agents get access to real business data:\n\n1. **Without data:** Ask about Seer Equity loan rates. Watch the AI give generic (or wrong) answers.\n2. **With data:** Connect the agent to actual loan policies and client information.\n3. **The difference:** The same question now returns real rates, real requirements, real client details.\n\nEnterprise data is what turns a generic AI into YOUR AI—one that knows your business.\n\n**What you'll build:** An agent connected to Seer Equity's loan policies and applicant data.\n\n**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes",
