I've explained my rate arrangement every time I call. Why doesn't anyone remember?\"*\n\nThe answer: The AI assistants have amnesia. Every conversation starts fresh. They don't remember what happened yesterday, what they learned about a client last week, or what exceptions were approved before.\n\n### What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lab, you'll experience this problem firsthand:\n\n1. Tell an agent important information about a client (preferences, rate exceptions, relationship history)\n2. The agent acknowledges and seems to understand\n3. Clear the session (simulating the next day)\n4. Ask the agent what it knows about that client\n5. **It has no idea who you're talking about**\n\nThis is exactly what's happening to Seer Equity's clients. And it's why memory isn't optional—it's essential.\n\n**What you'll experience:** The forgetting problem that frustrates clients and costs business.\n\n**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes",
