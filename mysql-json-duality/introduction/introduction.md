# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Modern applications often need to work with both document-centric JSON and traditional relational data. JSON Relational Duality Views introduce a new way to unify these models where you can seamlessly read and write hierarchical JSON documents mapped directly to normalized relational tables, gaining both development agility and robust data integrity. This feature is available in MySQL HeatWave, MySQL Enterprise Edition, and in read-only mode in MySQL Community Edition.

In this workshop, you will use JSON Duality Views enabling you to seamlessly integrate the flexibility of hierarchical JSON documents with the reliability and efficiency of relational database structures.

By leveraging JSON Duality Views, you get the best of both worlds:

- The query and integrity strengths of traditional relational models
- The flexible, modern data exchange patterns of the JSON model

### Objectives

JSON Duality Views allow you to define and store queries that present relational data as virtual JSON documents. With this feature, you can map complex relationships and tables into easily consumable multi-level JSON structures perfect for modern applications and REST APIs that require both structured and semi-structured data access.

In this workshop, you will learn:

- Exploring JSON Duality Views with MySQL
- Perform insert, update and delete operations against JSON Duality Views
- Modifying data with JSON Relational Duality Views
- Optimistic Concurrency Control with JSON Duality Views

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes
