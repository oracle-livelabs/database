# Manual Patching of a Container Database

## Introduction

In this lab, you will manually patch a container database. The *CDB19* database is running on 19.27 and you will patch it to an existing Oracle home on 19.28. In addition, you will check how PDBs behaves during patching.

Estimated Time: 15 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Patch a container database
* Check PDB behavior

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

* You have completed Lab 2: Simple Patching With AutoUpgrade

## Task 1: Patch a container database

You will patch *CDB19* to 19.28 and use an existing Oracle home.

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Set the environment to the *CDB19* database and connect.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    . cdb19
    sql / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Start the database.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    startup
    </copy>
    ```

3. Create a new PDB.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    create pluggable database indigo admin user admin identified by oracle;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> create pluggable database indigo admin user admin identified by oracle;

    Pluggable database created.
    ```

    </details>

4. Check the current version.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select version_full from v$instance;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> select version_full from v$instance;

    VERSION_FULL
    -----------------
    19.27.0.0.0
    ```

    </details>

5. Shut down the database, so you can patch it to 19.28.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    shutdown immediate
    </copy>
    ```

    * You must shut down a single instance database to patch it. In contrast, if it was an Oracle RAC Database, you could patch it using the *RAC Rolling* method without downtime.

6. Exit SQLcl.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

7. Move the SPFile and password file to the new Oracle home.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    export NEW_ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/19_28
    export OLD_ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/19
    mv $OLD_ORACLE_HOME/dbs/spfileCDB19.ora $NEW_ORACLE_HOME/dbs
    mv $OLD_ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapwCDB19 $NEW_ORACLE_HOME/dbs
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * In this lab, there is no PFile, so we don't need to move that one.
    * Also, there are no network files, like `tnsnames.ora` and `sqlnet.ora` in `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` so we don't move those either.
    * There might be many other files in the Oracle home. Check the blog post [Files to Move During Oracle Database Out-Of-Place Patching](https://dohdatabase.com/2023/05/30/files-to-move-during-oracle-database-out-of-place-patching/) for details.

8. You need to set the environment to the new Oracle home. Update the profile script and reset the environment.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    sed -i 's|^ORACLE_HOME=.*|ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/19_28|' /usr/local/bin/cdb19
    . cdb19
    env | grep ORA
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

9. Update `/etc/oratab` to reflect the new Oracle home.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    sed 's|^CDB19:.*|CDB19:/u01/app/oracle/product/19_28:Y|' /etc/oratab > /tmp/oratab
    cat /tmp/oratab > /etc/oratab
    grep "CDB19" /etc/oratab
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

10. Connect to the database.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    sql / as sysdba
    </copy>
    ```

11. Start the database instance and check PDBs.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    startup
    show pdbs
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Notice how the *INDIGO* PDB doesn't start because you didn't save the state.

    ```

    </details>

12. Exit SQLcl.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Examine Datapatch behavior

1. Remain in the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨.

2. Run Datapatch to apply the SQL changes to the database. It takes a few minutes to apply the patches. Wait for Datapatch to complete.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/datapatch
    </copy>
    ```

    * Datapatch patches only the open PDBs. It prints a warning for the *INDIGO* PDB.
    * `Warning: PDB INDIGO is in mode MOUNTED and will be skipped.`
    * Scroll through the output and see how Datapatch applies changes to all containers, including CDB$ROOT and PDB$SEED.

3. Connect to the database.

    ```

4. Open the *INDIGO* PDB.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    alter pluggable database indigo open;
    </copy>
    ```

    * The PDB opens with errors.

    ```

    * The PDB won't open because it hasn't been properly patched.
    * The dictionary version of the CDB$ROOT and the PDB are now different and must be aligned.
    * Datapatch skipped the PDB because it was not open.

6. Although the PDB is open, it is in *restricted* mode. Only users with *restricted session* privilege can connect.

    ``` sql

    ```

    * Notice *YES* in the *RESTRICTED* column of *INDIGO*.
    * Datapatch can patch a PDB as long as it is open *READ WRITE*. Even if a PDB is open in *RESTRICTED* mode, you can still patch it with Datapatch.

7. You can override this behavior and force the database to open unpatched PDBs.

    ``` sql

    alter pluggable database indigo close;
    alter pluggable database indigo open;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Notice that *INDIGO* now opens without errors.
    * **Use this underscore parameter with caution!** Although the PDB opens unrestricted, it is still unpatched.
    * Although you can use the parameter to forcefully open the PDB and allow users to connect, you must still complete the patching process.

    </details>

8. Check the status of the PDB.

    ``` sql
    <copy>

    ```

    * Notice *NO* in the *RESTRICTED* column of *INDIGO*.

             4 ORANGE        READ WRITE NO
    ```

    </details>

9. Exit SQLcl.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

10. Patch the *INDIGO* PDB.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/datapatch -pdbs INDIGO
    </copy>
    ```

    * The command line parameter `-pdbs` ensure that Datapatch just works on the *INDIGO* PDB.
    * You could also run Datapatch without the parameter. It would then examine the database and determine only *INDIGO* needed patching. However, this might take slightly longer.
