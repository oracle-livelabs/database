# Simple Patching With AutoUpgrade

## Introduction

In this lab, you will patch an Oracle Database in the most simple way using AutoUpgrade. AutoUpgrade not only patches the database but also downloads the right patches and builds a new Oracle home. This allows you to apply patches using the *out-of-place* method according to our best practices.

In the lab environment there is no connection to download patches from My Oracle Support, so all patches are already downloaded.

Estimated Time: 30 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Assess the patch readiness of a database
* Patch a database

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

* You have completed Lab 1: Initialize Environment

## Task 1: Analyze database

Oracle recommends that you first check your database. AutoUpgrade in *analyze* mode is a lightweight and non-intrusive check of an Oracle Database.

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. AutoUpgrade requires a *config* file with information about the database that you want to patch. In this lab, you use a pre-created config file. Examine the config file.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd
    cat scripts/pt-02-simple-patching.cfg
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * `source_home` and `sid` describe the current database.
    * `target_home` is the location of the new Oracle home. It doesn't exist yet. AutoUpgrade creates it for you. AutoUpgrade uses the settings from the source Oracle home to create the new one.
    * `folder` is the location where AutoUpgrade can find and store patch files. Ideally, this location is a network share accessible to all your database hosts.
    * `patch` informs AutoUpgrade which patches you want to apply. `RECOMMENDED` means the recent-most OPatch and Release Update plus matching OJVM and Data Pump bundle patches. In addition, you're adding a one-off patch.
    * `download` tells whether AutoUpgrade should attempt to download the patches from My Oracle Support using your My Oracle Support credentials. This is not possible inside this lab environment, so all patches have been pre-downloaded.

    patch1.folder=/home/oracle/patch-repo
    patch1.patch=RECOMMENDED,37738908
    patch1.download=no
    ```

    </details>

2. Analyze the database.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config scripts/pt-02-simple-patching.cfg -patch -mode analyze
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>

    patch>
    ```

    </details>

3. You are now in the AutoUpgrade console. Monitor the progress.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    lsj -a 10
    </copy>
    ```

    * The `lsj` command lists active jobs.
    * The `-a 10` parameter refreshes the information every 10 seconds.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    patch> lsj -a 10
    patch> +----+-------+---------+---------+-------+----------+-------+----------------+
    |Job#|DB_NAME|    STAGE|OPERATION| STATUS|START_TIME|UPDATED|         MESSAGE|

    +----+-------+---------+---------+-------+----------+-------+----------------+
    Total jobs 1

    The command lsj is running every 10 seconds. PRESS ENTER TO EXIT
    ```

    </details>

4. Wait a minute or two until AutoUpgrade completes. Don't exit from the AutoUpgrade console.

5. When the job completes, AutoUpgrade prints the location of the *summary report* which contains detailed information about the analysis. Check the summary report.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/autoupgrade-patching/simple-patching/log/cfgtoollogs/patch/auto/status/status.log
    </copy>
    ```

    * You can see that you're patching the *FTEX* database.
    * You can also see that you're patching from 19.27 to 19.28.
    * In this lab, you can only use already downloaded patches. When this lab was created, 19.28 was the latest Release Update. 
    * In your own environment, when AutoUpgrade downloads patches, it will always take the latest available Release Upgrade from MOS when you specify *patch=recommended*. 
    * In the end, you can see that all checks passed and there's no manual intervention needed.
    * This database was found to be ready for patching.

## Task 2: Patch database

Patching a single instance Oracle Database require downtime.

**Downtime starts now.**

1. Start patching the database.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config scripts/pt-02-simple-patching.cfg -patch -mode deploy
    </copy>
    ```

    * You're reusing the same command line as the analysis, however, this time you are activating deploy mode.
    * Deploy mode is the complete automation which performs all parts of a patch process.
    * Since AutoUpgrade is in *patching* mode, the prompt is `patch>`.

    ```

    </details>

2. Again, you're in the AutoUpgrade console. Monitor the progress.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    lsj -a 10
    </copy>
    ```

    * The `lsj` command lists active jobs.
    * The `-a 10` parameter refreshes the information every 10 seconds.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    lsj -a 10
    patch> +----+-------+---------+---------+-------+----------+-------+----------------+

    Total jobs 1

    The command lsj is running every 10 seconds. PRESS ENTER TO EXIT
    ```

    </details>

3. Hit *Enter* to stop the automatic refresh. Let's get more information about the process.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    status -job 101 -a 10
    </copy>
    ```

    * The `status` command gives much more details.
    * It requires the *jobid* which you can find in the output of `lsj`.
    * Take a look at the different stages that the job will go through.

    </details>

4. In the output of the `status` command, you can see where AutoUpgrade stores log files. Examine the log files.

5. Leave AutoUpgrade running. Switch to the *blue* terminal ðŸŸ¦. Examine the job logging directory.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd /home/oracle/autoupgrade-patching/simple-patching/log/FTEX/101
    ll
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The output in your lab varies from the sample output.
    * Notice how each stage has a subdirectory

6. Check the the *user* log file.

    ```

    * The output is different in your lab environment.
    * Examine the content to understand that AutoUpgrade is doing behind the scenes.
    * AutoUpgrade prints the patches that it will install. In this case, it is the 19.28 Relese Update plus matching OJVM and Data Pump bundle patches. In addition, it also updated OPatch and installed a one-off patch.

7. Spend some time examining the other log files and subdirectories.

8. Switch back to the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. **It takes around 20 minutes to patch the database**. If AutoUpgrade is still running, you either wait or you can perform lab 3, *Familiarize with patching*.

## Task 3: Patch database, continued

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. When AutoUpgrade completes, it prints a message to the console and exists.

    * AutoUpgrade informs that there is a guaranteed restore point which you must remove when it is no longer needed. Don't remove the restore point yet.
    * Optionally, you can instruct AutoUpgrade to remove the restore point automatically using `drop_grp_after_upgrade=yes` in the config file.

    ```

    </details>

2. Update the profile script. Since the database now runs out of a new Oracle home, you must update the profile script. This command replaces the `ORACLE_HOME` variable in the profile script.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    sed -i 's|^ORACLE_HOME=.*|ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/19_28|' /usr/local/bin/ftex
    </copy>
    ```

3. That's it. You just patched your Oracle Database including:

    * Building a brand-new Oracle home enabling out-of-place patching
    * Updating OPatch
    * Installing Release Update and bundle patches
    * Required and recommended pre- and post-tasks
    * Copying database configuration files from old to new Oracle home
    * Restarting database in new Oracle home
    * Executing Datapatch

You may now [*proceed to the next lab*](#next).
