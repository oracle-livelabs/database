# Familiarize With Patching

## Introduction

In this lab, you will familiarize with some of the tools used to patch Oracle Database.

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Check the tools needed for patching
* Check an Oracle Database

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

* You have completed Lab 1: Initialize Environment

This is an optional lab. You can skip it if you are already familiar with patching Oracle Database.

## Task 1: Use OPatch from shell

You use *OPatch* to perform the first part of patching an Oracle Database; patching the Oracle home. OPatch replaces some files in the Oracle home and might also add new files. If the Oracle home is in use, for instance by a database instance or listener, you must stop those processes.

1. Use the *blue* terminal ðŸŸ¦. Set the environment to *UPGR* and change to the Oracle home.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    . upgr
    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. You find OPatch in a subdirectory. Check the version of OPatch.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd OPatch
    ./opatch version
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    ``` text
    $ cd OPatch
    $ ./opatch version
    OPatch Version: 12.2.0.1.46

    OPatch succeeded.
    ```

    </details>

3. There are other means of finding the OPatch version.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cat version.txt
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    $ cat version.txt
    OPATCH_VERSION:12.2.0.1.46
    ```

    </details>

4. Update OPatch by unzipping the OPatch patch file. Keep the old Oracle home as back.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    mv OPatch OPatch_backup
    unzip /home/oracle/patch-repo/p6880880_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You should always use the latest version of OPatch.
    * AutoUpgrade automatically updates OPatch when you use `patch=RECOMMENDED` or includes the `OPATCH` keyword in the the `patch=` specification.
    * You can manually download the latest of OPatch from My Oracle Support. Search for patch *6880880*.

      inflating: OPatch/modules/javax.activation.javax.activation.jar
    ```

    </details>

5. Check the new version of OPatch

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch version
    </copy>
    ```

    * The previous version of OPatch was *12.2.0.1.46*.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    $ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch version
    OPatch Version: 12.2.0.1.47

    OPatch succeeded.
    ```

    </details>

6. Check the patches currently installed.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lspatches
    </copy>
    ```

    * Currently, the Oracle home on Release Update 19.27.
    * The OJVM and Data Pump bundle patches are installed as well.
    * You can see that the OCW component in the Oracle home has not been updated. It's still on the base release, *19.3.0.0.0*. Oracle requires that the OCW component is updated only when you use Oracle RAC or Oracle Restart, which is not the case in this lab. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to always update the component. You'll see how you can do that in another lab using the `OCW` keyword in the `patch` parameter.

    29585399;OCW RELEASE UPDATE 19.3.0.0.0 (29585399)

    OPatch succeeded.
    ```

    </details>

7. Get detailed information about the patches in the Oracle home.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    OPatch/opatch lsinventory > opatch_lsinventory.txt
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You spool the contents to a file.
    * If you create a service request in My Oracle Support, it is often a good idea to attach the file.
    * The file is mandatory in many cases, e.g., when requesting a merge patch or backport.

8. Examine the contents of the file.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    more opatch_lsinventory.txt
    </copy>
    ```

    * Use *Space* to browse through the pages.
    * Use *CTRL+C* to break when you'se seen enough.

## Task 2: Use OPatch inside the database

You can use the *queryable inventory* inside the database to get information from OPatch.

1. Remain in the *blue* terminal ðŸŸ¦. Connect to the *UPGR* database.

     ``` sql
    <copy>
    . upgr
    sql / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Get information about Oracle home.

     ``` sql
    <copy>

5. Exit SQLcl.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Use Datapatch

Datapatch applies or rolls back SQL changes to the database.

1. Remain in the *blue* terminal ðŸŸ¦. You find Datapatch in the *OPatch* directory.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch
    ls -l datapatch
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    -rwxr-x---. 1 oracle oinstall 589 Oct  4 18:43 datapatch
    ```

    </details>

2. Check the version of Datapatch.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ./datapatch -version
    </copy>
    ```

    * Although Datapatch is located in the *OPatch* directory, you update Datapatch via Release Updates, not by updating OPatch.

3. Run the prerequisites check.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ./datapatch -prereq
    </copy>
    ```

    * Datapatch works on one database only.
    * This check is non-intrusive. It examines your database and checks if Datapatch needs to install patches.
    * Datapatch reports that no patches need to be applied.
    * If you need to work on two databases at the same time, you would need to start another terminal, set the environment accordingly, and execute Datapatch.

## Task 4: Useful queries

Here are a few useful queries that informs about the database.

1. Still connected to the *UPGR* database. Get the Oracle home of the database.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select sys_context('USERENV','ORACLE_HOME') as oracle_home from dual;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> select sys_context('USERENV','ORACLE_HOME') as oracle_home from dual;

                      ORACLE_HOME
    _____________________________
    /u01/app/oracle/product/19
    ```

    </details>

2. Get the full version of the database.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select version_full from v$instance;
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> select version_full from v$instance;

       VERSION_FULL
    _______________
    19.27.0.0.0
    ```

    </details>

3. List the components installed in the database.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    select comp_id,
           version_full,
           status
    from dba_registry
    order by comp_id;
    </copy>
    ```

    * All components are either *VALID* or *OPTION OFF*. All looks good.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    SQL> select comp_id,
      2         version_full,
      3         status
      4  from dba_registry
      5* order by comp_id;

       COMP_ID    VERSION_FULL        STATUS
    __________ _______________ _____________
    CATALOG    19.27.0.0.0     VALID
    CATPROC    19.27.0.0.0     VALID
    OWM        19.27.0.0.0     VALID
    RAC        19.27.0.0.0     OPTION OFF
    XDB        19.27.0.0.0     VALID
    ```

    </details>

4. Exit SQLcl.

    ``` sql
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 5: Check AutoUpgrade

Oracle recommends that you always use the latest version of AutoUpgrade.

1. Check the version of AutoUpgrade.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -version
    </copy>

    # Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * *MOS_LINK* contains the URL to the My Oracle Support document where you can download the latest version of AutoUpgrade.
    * You can also download AutoUpgrade directly from oracle.com without logging on to My Oracle Support.
    * In this lab, you will use the existing version.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>

    ``` text
    $ cd
    $ java -jar autoupgrade.jar -version
    build.version 25.4.250730
    build.date 2025/07/30 16:33:06 +0000
    build.hash d12ffb74e
    build.hash_date 2025/07/24 14:59:09 +0000
    build.supported_target_versions 12.2,18,19,21,23
    build.type production
    build.label (HEAD, tag: v25.4, origin/stable_devel, stable_devel)
    build.MOS_NOTE 2485457.1
    build.MOS_LINK https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2485457.1
    ```
