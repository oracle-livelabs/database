# Familiarize With Patching

## Introduction

In this lab, you will familiarize with some of the tools used to patch Oracle Database. 

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Check the tools needed for patching
* Check an Oracle Database

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 1: Initialize Environment

This is an optional lab. You can skip it if you are already familiar with patching Oracle Database.

## Task 1: Use OPatch from shell

You use *OPatch* to perform the first part of patching an Oracle Database; patching the Oracle home. OPatch replaces some files in the Oracle home and might also add new files. If the Oracle home is in use, for instance by a database instance or listener, you must stop those processes. 

1. Use the *blue* ðŸŸ¦ terminal. Set the environment to *UPGR* and change to the Oracle home.

    ```
    <copy>
    . upgr
    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. You find OPatch in a subdirectory. Check the version of OPatch.
    
    ```
    <copy>
    cd OPatch
    ./opatch version
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ cd OPatch
    $ ./opatch version
    OPatch Version: 12.2.0.1.42
    
    OPatch succeeded.
    ```
    </details>        

3. There are other means of finding the OPatch version.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat version.txt
    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ cat version.txt
    OPATCH_VERSION:12.2.0.1.42
    ```
    </details>  

4. Update OPatch by unzipping the OPatch patch file. Keep the old Oracle home as back.
    
    ```
    <copy>
    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    mv OPatch OPatch_backup
    unzip /home/oracle/patch-repo/p6880880_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You should always use the latest version of OPatch. 
    * You can download the latest of OPatch from My Oracle Support. Search for patch *6880880*.

    <details>

      inflating: OPatch/modules/javax.activation.javax.activation.jar
    ```
    </details>    

5. Check the new version of OPatch
    
    ```
    <copy>
    $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch version
    </copy>
    ```

    * The previous version of OPatch was *12.2.0.1.42*.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch version
    OPatch Version: 12.2.0.1.44
    
    OPatch succeeded.
    ```
    </details>     

6. Check the patches currently installed.

    ```
    <copy>
    $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lspatches
    </copy>
    ```

    * Currently, the Oracle home on Release Update 19.21.0.
    * The OJVM and Data Pump bundle patches are installed as well.
    * You can ignore the OCW Release Update.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    $ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lspatches
    35648110;OJVM RELEASE UPDATE: 19.21.0.0.231017 (35648110)
    35787077;DATAPUMP BUNDLE PATCH 19.21.0.0.0
    35643107;Database Release Update : 19.21.0.0.231017 (35643107)
    29585399;OCW RELEASE UPDATE 19.3.0.0.0 (29585399)
    
    OPatch succeeded.
    ```
    </details>   

7. Get detailed information about the patches in the Oracle home.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    OPatch/opatch lsinventory > opatch_lsinventory.txt
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You spool the contents to a file.
    * If you create a service request in My Oracle Support, it is often a good idea to attach the file.
    * The file is mandatory in many cases, e.g., when requesting a merge patch or backport.

    <details>

    ``` text
    $ cd $ORACLE_HOME
    $ OPatch/opatch lsinventory > opatch_lsinventory.txt
    ```
    </details>  

8. Examine the contents of the file.

    ```
    <copy>
    more opatch_lsinventory.txt
    </copy>
    ```

    * Use *Space* to browse through the pages.

## Task 2: Use OPatch inside the database

You can use the *queryable inventory* inside the database to get information from OPatch.

1. Remain in the *blue* ðŸŸ¦ terminal. Connect to the *UPGR* database.

     ```
    <copy>
    . upgr
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

2. Get information about Oracle home.

     ```

4. Get the output of `opatch lsinventory` and find the patches installed.

    ```
    <copy>
    with inv as (select dbms_qopatch.get_opatch_lsinventory output from dual) 
    select patches.patch_id, patches.patch_unique_id, patches.description 
    from inv, 
         xmltable('InventoryInstance/patches/*' passing inv.output columns patch_id number path 'patchID', patch_unique_id number path 'uniquePatchID', description varchar2(80) path 'patchDescription') patches;
    </copy>
    ```

    * The output is a very detailed XML document. 
    * You can extract the information of interest.
    * Here you are extracting the patches installed.

    ```
    </details>    

5. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Use Datapatch

Datapatch applies or rolls back SQL changes to the database. 

1. Remain in the *blue* ðŸŸ¦ terminal. You find Datapatch in the *OPatch* directory. 
    
    ```
    <copy>
    cd $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch
    ls -l datapatch
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    -rwxr-x---. 1 oracle oinstall 589 Oct  4 18:43 datapatch
    ```
    </details>    

2. Check the version of Datapatch.

    ```
    <copy>
    ./datapatch -version
    </copy>
    ```

    * Although Datapatch is located in the *OPatch* directory, you update Datapatch via Release Updates, not by updating OPatch.

3. Run the prerequisites check.

    ```
    <copy>
    ./datapatch -prereq
    </copy>
    ```

    * Datapatch works on one database only.
    * This check is non-instrusive. It examines your database and checks if Datapatch needs to install patches.
    * Datapatch reports that no patches need to be applied.
    * If you need to work on two databases at the same time, you would need to start another terminal, set the environment accordingly, and execute Datapatch.

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Datapatch keeps track of all apply and rollback actions in a database.
    * You can see those using this view.
    * Over time, as you patch this database, you will see more actions.

## Task 4: Useful queries

Here are a few useful queries that informs about the database.

1. Still connected to the *UPGR* database. Get the Oracle home of the database.

    ```
    <copy>
    col oracle_home format a60

    </copy>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    SQL> select version_full from v$instance;

    VERSION_FULL
    -----------------
    19.21.0.0.0
    ```
    </details>     

3. List the components installed in the database.

    ```
    <copy>
    col comp_id format a10
    col version_full format a15
    col status format a15    
    select comp_id,
           version_full,
           status
    from dba_registry
    order by comp_id;
    </copy>
    ```

    * All components are either *VALID* or *OPTION OFF*. All looks good.

## Task 5: Check AutoUpgrade

Oracle recommends that you always use the latest version of AutoUpgrade.

1. Check the version of AutoUpgrade.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -version
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * *MOS_LINK* contains the URL to the My Oracle Support document where you can download the latest version of AutoUpgrade.
    * In this lab, you will use the existing version.
