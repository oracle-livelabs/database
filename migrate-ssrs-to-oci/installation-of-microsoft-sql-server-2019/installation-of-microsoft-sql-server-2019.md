# Provision of the Compute Instance from Market Place Image for SQL Server 2019

## Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to provision Microsoft SQL Server 2019 from the Market Place Image in a Compute Instance.

Estimated Time:  1 hour

### Objectives
In this lab, you will learn to:
* Deploy Microsoft SQL Server 2019 from the marketplace image
* Install Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- A Free or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- IAM policies to create resources in the compartment
- Required Subnets are available in VCN

##  Task 1: Provision the SQL Server 2019 from Market Place

1. Open the navigation menu, click **Marketplace**, and then click **All Applications**.

  ![OCI Marketplace](./images/compute-instance-oci.png "OCI Marketplace")

2. Marketplace **All Applications** will be shown below. Search for **SQL Server 2019** image and select the desired edition for SQL Server. The marketplace image is available in Enterprise and Standard Edition. Always On Basic Availability Groups provide a high availability solution for SQL Server from version 2016 and above on Standard Edition. An Availability Group supports a failover environment for a single database in Standard Edition.

##  Task 2: Download and install SQL Server Management Studio

1. Download and install SQL Server Management Studio [link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2195969&clcid=0x409) from the browser.

  ![OCI Compute Instance status](./images/managementstudiodownload.png "OCI Compute Instance status")

2. Click on **SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe** to install the SQL Server Management Studio. The installation process is shown in the following image. 

  ![SQL Server Management Studio installation progress](./images/sqlservermanagementstudioinstallation.png "SQL Server Management Studio installation progress")
