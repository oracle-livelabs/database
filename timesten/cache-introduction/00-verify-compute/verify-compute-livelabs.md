# Connect to the workshop compute instance

## Introduction
This lab shows you how to login to your pre-created compute instance running on Oracle Cloud.

**Estimated Lab Time:** 10 minutes

### Objectives

- Learn how to connect to your compute instance using the NoVNC Remote Desktop.
- Learn the basics of using the NoVNC Desktop, including copy and paste.
- Configure and use SSH access to the compute instance (optional).

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have successfully submitted a reservation using the **Run on LiveLabs** option.
- Your reservation has been successfully provisioned and started and is ready to use.
- You have an RSA format SSH private/public key pair to access the compute instance using SSH (optional).

## Task 1: Access the NoVNC Graphical Remote Desktop
For ease of execution of this workshop, your VM instance has been pre-configured with a remote graphical desktop accessible using any modern browser on your laptop or workstation. Proceed as detailed below to login.
 
1. Now that your instance has been provisioned, navigate to **My Reservations**, find the request you submitted from the list displayed (only one item will be displayed if this is your first request).

   ![my reservation](images/my-reservations.png "my reservation")

2. Click on **Launch Workshop** after the reservation provisioning has been completed.

    ![my reservation completed](images/my-reservation-completed.png "my reservation completed") 

3. Click on **View Login info** and then on **Launch Remote Desktop** link.

    ![Login information](images/login-info.png "Login Information")

    This should take you directly to your remote desktop in a single click.

**Note:**  While rare, you _may_ see an error titled **Deceptive Site Ahead**, or similar, depending on your browser type, as shown below.

![site error message](images/novnc-deceptive-site-error.png "site error message ")

Public IP addresses used for LiveLabs provisioning come from a pool of reusable addresses. This error is due to the fact that the address was previously used by a different compute instance, long terminated, which wasn't properly cleaned up.

You can safely ignore this error. Proceed by clicking on **Details**, and finally on **visit this unsafe site**.

## Task 2: Enable NoVNC Full-screen Display

To make the best use of your display, perform the following tasks to render your remote desktop session in fullscreen mode.

1. Click on the small gray tab on the middle-left side of your screen to open the control bar.

    ![Click left gray tab](./images/novnc-fullscreen-1.png " ")

2. Select *Fullscreen* to render the session on your entire screen.

    ![Select Full Screen icon](./images/novnc-fullscreen-2.png " ")
    ![Full Screen](./images/novnc-fullscreen-3.png " ")

  *Note:* The Full-screen option is available if the browser supports it. Switch to another browser if you don't see the full-screen option in the control bar.  
  
## Task 3: Enable Copy/Paste from Local to Remote Desktop

During the execution of this workshop you will need to copy text from the workshop instructions (use the copy button provided) to a terminal session (remote desktop or SSH). As direct copy/paste between your local browser and the NoVNC desktop isn't supported, you may proceed as indicated below to enable an alternative local-to-remote clipboard using the NoVNC Clipboard.

1. Continuing from the last task above, Select the *clipboard* icon.

    ![Select clipboard icon](./images/novnc-clipboard-1.png " ")

2. Copy some text from your local computer as illustrated below and paste into the clipboard widget, then finally open up the desired application (e.g. Terminal) and paste accordingly using *mouse controls*.

    ![Paste text into the clipboard text box](./images/novnc-clipboard-2.png " ")

*Note:* Please make sure you initialize your clipboard with step [1] shown in the screenshot above before opening the target application in which you intend to paste the text. Otherwise you will find the *paste* function in the context menu grayed out when attempting to paste for the first time.
    
**IMPORTANT:** Due to the slightly cumbersome nature of copying between your host system and the NoVNC session, we recommend that you perform all of the copy/paste actions within the NoVNC session itself, as this avoids the use of the NoVNC clipboard. Alternatively, access the workshop's compute instance using SSH and copy/paste between the lab instructions displayed in your local browser and your SSH session.

If you will be using the NoVNC desktop for the workshop, make sure that you have an open terminal session. If you have closed the terminal session that was open when you first logged in, open a new one now using **Activities > Terminal** from the Linux desktop menu bar. 

## Task 4: Configure and use SSH access (optional)

While your workshop can be executed end-to-end from the remote desktop, follow the steps provided below if you prefer to access the instance remotely using an SSH client such as Putty, Unix/Linux/MacOS Terminal, OCI cloudshell, and other terminal emulators available on Windows.

*Note:* In this section you are enabling SSH access to the OS user running the remote desktop, which for this workshop is the **oracle** user.

This assumes that you already have an RSA type SSH key-pair available on the local system where you will be connecting from. If you don't, then for more info on creating and using SSH keys for your specific platform and client, please refer to the guide [Generate SSH Keys](https://docs.oracle.com/en/learn/generate_ssh_keys/index.html).

1. Open the remote clipboard on the remote desktop as shown in *Task 3* and launch a terminal session.

2. Paste the block below onto the remote clipboard first, then onto the terminal to create or update the file *\$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys* using the *vi* editor.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd $HOME/.ssh
    vi authorized_keys
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Open authorized_keys file](./images/novnc-copy-pub-key-4.png " ")
    
    Enter append mode in vi (type **A**), and start a new line if required.

3. From the local system (e.g. your laptop), with the exception of *Putty* users, locate the SSH _public_ key from your key-pair, open it, and copy the entire content to the clipboard.

    ![List public key using cat command](./images/novnc-copy-pub-key-1.png " ")

    If using *Putty* you must load the private key (*.ppk*) into *Puttygen* utility to see the relevant public key block to copy. Do not copy the content of the public key file directly as it will not work.

    ![Locate public key using Putty](./images/novnc-copy-pub-key-2.png " ")

4. Paste the copied public key into the remote clipboard first, then into the terminal where you opened the *authorized_keys* file for editing.

    ![Paste public key to clipboard](./images/novnc-copy-pub-key-3.png " ")

5. Save and exit the *vi* editor (press the **Escape** key then type **ZZ**).

6. Set the required permissions on *authorized_keys*.

    ```
    <copy>
    chmod 0600 authorized_keys
    </copy>
    ```

7. Verify SSH connectivity using the private key (for Unix/Linux/MacOS Terminal, OCI cloudshell, and Terminal emulators on Windows such as Cygwin and MobaXterm).

    ```
    ssh -i [path to private key] remote-user@[instance-public-ip-address]
    e.g.
    <copy>
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/livelabs_rsa oracle@150.136.123.105
    </copy>
    ```

    If copy/pasting the above _example_, substitute the appropriate values for the SSH key private key file and the compute instance IP address.
    
    If you are using Putty, please refer to the guide [Generate SSH Keys](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/generate-ssh-key) on how to establish the connection using the *.ppk* private key.

You should now have an open terminal session in the compute instance, either through the NoVNC desktop or through SSH. Keep this session open for the next lab.

You can now **proceed to the next lab**.
