# Prepare the TimesTen cache

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create a TimesTen database and set it up to cache the required tables from the Oracle database.

**Estimated Lab Time:** 10 minutes

### Objectives

- Create a TimesTen database and prepare it to act as a cache
- Create the application schema users (APPUSER and OE)
- Create READONLY cache groups for the tables that you want to cache

These tasks are all accomplished using SQL statements, so they can be easily performed from application code if required.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have:

- Completed all the previous labs in this workshop, in sequence.

## Task 1: Connect to the environment

If you do not already have an active terminal session, connect to the OCI compute instance and open a terminal session, as the user **oracle**.

In that terminal session, connect to the TimesTen host (tthost1) using ssh.

## Task 2: Create the TimesTen database and prepare it for caching

A TimesTen database is implicitly created the first time the instance administrator user connects to it via its server DSN. In order to use the database as a cache, you must set the Oracle cache admin username and password and also start the TimesTen Cache Agent.

The Cache Agent is a TimesTen daemon process that manages many of the cache-related functions for a TimesTen database.

One of the most frequently used TimesTen utilities is the **ttIsql** utility. This is an interactive SQL utility that serves the same purpose for TimesTen as SQL*Plus does for Oracle Database.

Connect to the **sampledb** DSN using **ttIsql**:

```
<copy>
ttIsql sampledb
</copy>
```

```

Type ? or "help" for help, type "exit" to quit ttIsql.

connect "DSN=sampledb";
Connection successful: DSN=sampledb;UID=oracle;DataStore=/tt/db/sampledb;DatabaseCharacterSet=AL32UTF8;ConnectionCharacterSet=AL32UTF8;LogFileSize=256;LogBufMB=256;PermSize=1024;TempSize=256;OracleNetServiceName=ORCLPDB1;
(Default setting AutoCommit=1)
```
Set the Oracle cache administrator username and password (these are stored, encrypted, in the TimesTen database):

```
<copy>
call ttCacheUidPwdSet('ttcacheadm','ttcacheadm');
</copy>
```

Start the TimesTen Cache Agent for the cache database:

```
<copy>
call ttCacheStart;
</copy>
```

Create application users for the **OE** and **APPUSER** schemas and grant them some necessary privileges:

```
<copy>
CREATE USER oe IDENTIFIED BY "oe";
</copy>
```

```
User created.
```

```
<copy>
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE CACHE GROUP, CREATE TABLE TO oe;
</copy>
```

```
<copy>
CREATE USER appuser IDENTIFIED BY "appuser";
</copy>
```

```
User created.
```

```
<copy>
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE CACHE GROUP, CREATE TABLE TO appuser;
</copy>
```

Exit from ttIsql:

```
<copy>
quit
</copy>
```

```
Disconnecting...
Done.
```

## Task 3: Create the cache groups

Some useful definitions and concepts:

- A **cache group** is a SQL object that encapsulates a set of one or more tables that are related through primary key -> foreign key relationships. The (single) top-level table is called the root table and the other tables sit below it in a hierarchical parent/child arrangement.

- A **cache instance** consists of a single row from the root table and all the related rows from the subordinate tables down through the hierarchy within the cache group.

- Cache operations act on cache groups not on individual tables, or on cache instances as opposed to individual rows.

- Normal SQL operations, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, operate directly on the cache tables and the rows therein. 

Create the (multiple) cache groups for the **OE** schema tables. You will use a pre-prepared script to reduce the amount of typing or copying & pasting.

Use **ttIsql** to connect to the TimesTen cache as the **OE** user:

```
<copy>
ttIsql "DSN=sampledb;UID=oe;PWD=oe;OraclePWD=oe"
</copy>
```

```
Copyright (c) 1996, 2022, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.
Type ? or "help" for help, type "exit" to quit ttIsql.

connect "DSN=sampledb;UID=oe;PWD=********;OraclePWD=********";
Connection successful: DSN=sampledb;UID=oe;DataStore=/tt/db/sampledb;DatabaseCharacterSet=AL32UTF8;ConnectionCharacterSet=AL32UTF8;LogFileSize=256;LogBufMB=256;PermSize=1024;TempSize=256;OracleNetServiceName=ORCLPDB1;
(Default setting AutoCommit=1)
Command>
```
Run the script to create the OE cache groups:

```
<copy>
@scripts/createCacheGroupsOE;
</copy>
```

```
--
-- Put 'promotions' in its own cache group as it has
-- no child tables.
--

CREATE READONLY CACHE GROUP oe.cg_promotions
    AUTOREFRESH MODE INCREMENTAL INTERVAL 2 SECONDS
    STATE PAUSED
FROM
oe.promotions
( promo_id   NUMBER(6)
, promo_name VARCHAR2(20)
, PRIMARY KEY (promo_id)
);

â€¦

--
-- Create an index explicitly for the omitted FK
-- in case queries rely on it.
--

CREATE INDEX oe.order_items_fk
  ON oe.order_items (product_id);

```
Display the cachegroups owned by the OE user:

```
<copy>
cachegroups oe.%;
</copy>
```

```
Cache Group OE.CG_CUST_ORDERS:

  Cache Group Type: Read Only
  Autorefresh: Yes
  Autorefresh Mode: Incremental
  Autorefresh State: Paused
  Autorefresh Interval: 2 Seconds

```

Display the tables owned by the OE user. These are the tables that make up the cache groups:

```
<copy>
tables;
</copy>
```

```
  OE.CUSTOMERS
  OE.INVENTORIES
  OE.ORDERS
  OE.ORDER_ITEMS
  OE.PRODUCT_DESCRIPTIONS
  OE.PRODUCT_INFORMATION
  OE.PROMOTIONS
7 tables found.
```

```
<copy>
select count(*) from customers;
</copy>
```

```
< 0 >
1 row found.
```

```
<copy>
select count(*) from product_information;
</copy>
```

```
< 0 >
1 row found.
```

```
<copy>
select count(*) from promotions;
</copy>
```

```

Exit from ttIsql:

```
<copy>
quit
</copy>
```

```
Disconnecting...
Done.
```

The user OE has 3 cache groups, some containing single tables and others containing multiple tables. Currently, all the tables are empty.

Create the cache group for the **APPUSER.VPN\_USERS** table. This time you will type, or copy/paste, the individual commands:

```
<copy>
ttIsql "DSN=sampledb;UID=appuser;PWD=appuser;OraclePWD=appuser"
</copy>
```

```

, descr              CHAR(100 BYTE) NOT NULL
, PRIMARY KEY (vpn_id, vpn_nb)
);
</copy>
```

Display the cachegroup and table:

```
<copy>
cachegroups appuser.%;
</copy>
```

```
Cache Group APPUSER.CG_VPN_USERS:

  Cache Group Type: Read Only
  Autorefresh: Yes
  Autorefresh Mode: Incremental
  Autorefresh State: Paused
  Autorefresh Interval: 2 Seconds
  Autorefresh Status: ok
  Aging: No aging defined

  Root Table: APPUSER.VPN_USERS
  Table Type: Read Only

1 cache group found.
```

```
<copy>
tables;
</copy>
```

```
  APPUSER.VPN_USERS
1 table found.
```

```
<copy>
select count(*) from vpn_users;
</copy>
```

```
< 0 >
1 row found.
```

Exit from ttIsql:

```
<copy>
quit
</copy>
```

```
Disconnecting...
Done.
```

The TimesTen mechanism that captures data changes that occur in the Oracle database and uses those changes to refresh the cached data is called **AUTOREFRESH**. Note that for all of the cache groups that you just created, the status of this mechanism is currently **Paused**.

```
Autorefresh State: Paused
```
In order to pre-populate the cache tables and activate the AUTOREFRESH mechanism, you must now load the cache groups, which you will do in the next lab.

You can now *proceed to the next lab*. Keep your terminal session open for use in the next lab.
