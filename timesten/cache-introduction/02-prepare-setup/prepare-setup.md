# Prepare Setup

## Introduction

In this lab, you will download the Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) stack zip file needed to setup the resource needed to run this workshop. This workshop requires a compute instance and a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) and subnet.

Estimated Time: **15 minutes**

### Objectives

-   Download the workshop's ORM stack
-   Configure an existing Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) - optional

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- An Oracle Cloud account with enough resources to run this workshop. The minimum requirements are **4 CPUs, 32 GB RAM, 100 GB storage and one VCN/subnet**.

## Task 1: Download Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) stack zip file

1.  Click on the link below to download the Resource Manager zip file you need to build your environment:

 [ll-timesten-cache-intro.zip](https://objectstorage.uk-london-1.oraclecloud.com/p/puzLjtCV8NbFGkuRWo1lVsdeFqS5E91KZ1Rfa7fkidhPEGVxuFTbtT32zkXOXtl0/n/intdouglashood/b/stacks/o/ll-timesten-cache-intro.zip)

2.  Save in your downloads folder.

We strongly recommend using this stack to create a self-contained/dedicated VCN with your instance(s). Skip to *Task 3* to follow our recommendations. If you would rather use an exiting VCN then proceed to the next task to update your existing VCN with the required Egress rules.

## Task 2: Adding security rules to an existing VCN

This workshop requires a certain number of ports to be available, a requirement that can be met by using the default ORM stack execution that creates a dedicated VCN. In order to use an existing VCN/subnet the following ports should be added to the Ingress rules.

| Port           |Description                            |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| 22             | SSH                                   |
| 80             | Remote Desktiop using noVNC           |
| 6080           | Remote Desktop using noVNC            |

1.  Go to *Networking >> Virtual Cloud Networks*

2.  Choose your network

3.  Under Resources, select *Security Lists*

4.  Click on *Default Security Lists *under the Create Security List button

5.  Click *Add Ingress Rule* button

6.  Enter the following:
    - Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
    - Destination Port Range: *Refer to above table*

7.  Click the Add Ingress Rules button

## Task 3: Setup your OCI compute instance

Using the details from the two steps above, proceed to the lab *Environment Setup* to setup your workshop environment using Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) using one of the following options:

  -  Create Stack:  *Compute + Networking*
  -  Create Stack:  *Compute only* using an existing VCN where security lists have been updated as per *Task 2* above

**IMPORTANT:** When deploying the workshop compute instance via the ORM stack, it is strongly recommended that you enable the optional SSH access using either your own SSH public key or a generated SSH key pair. SSH connectivity offers a better user experience, especially for copy/paste, than noVNC connectivity.

You may now *proceed to the next lab (Environment setup)*.
