# Wrap Up

## Summary

Congratulations, *you have completed the workshop*. 

In this workshop you have learnt how to setup TimesTen Classic as a relational, in-memory, read-only cache for tables in an Oracle database. You have also seen the amazing performance benefits that can be achieved by using TimesTen.

## Starting over

If you want to redo this lab from the beginning using the same cloud instance then you can easily do so. Just go back to the lab titled **Initialize the workshop environment** and start from the step *Starting over from the beginning*.

## Resource cleanup

If you are running the workshop in the LiveLabs sandbox, the resources will be cleaned up automatically when the workshop time limit expires. No further action is required on your part.

If you are running the workshop in your own tenancy, go to the stack that you used to deploy the environment and run the **Destroy** operation to cleanup all the resources. You can then delete the stack itself.
