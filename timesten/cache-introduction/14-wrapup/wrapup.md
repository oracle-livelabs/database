# Wrap Up

## Summary

Congratulations! You completed the workshop. 

In this workshop you learned how to setup TimesTen Classic as a relational, in-memory, read-only cache for tables in an Oracle database. You also discovered the amazing performance benefits that can be achieved by using TimesTen.

## Start over

If you want to redo this lab from the beginning using the same cloud instance then you can do so. Go back to the lab entitled **Initialize the workshop environment** and start from the *Start over from the beginning* step.

## Resource cleanup

If you are running the workshop in the LiveLabs sandbox, the resources are cleaned up automatically when the workshop time limit expires. No further action is required on your part.

If you are running the workshop in your own tenancy, go to the stack that you used to deploy the environment and run the **Destroy** operation to clean up all the resources. You can then delete the stack itself.
