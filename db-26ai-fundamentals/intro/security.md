## About Oracle AI Database 26ai

Building on the strengths of its predecessor, Oracle AI Database 26ai represents the latest long-term support release, delivering new cutting-edge technology. Just like Oracle AI Database 19c, version 26ai provides best-in-class support for all data types, including the new Vector data type along with relational, JSON, XML, spatial, graph, and more, coupled with industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and security for various workloads.

Users of Oracle Database 19c and 21c can directly upgrade to Oracle AI Database 26ai.

## About the Security New Features Section

This section explores some of the new Security features in Oracle AI Database 26ai.
* **SQL Firewall:** 
    - SQL Firewall offers real-time protection against common database attacks by monitoring and blocking unauthorized SQL and SQL injection attacks from inside the database. 

- **Schema Level Privileges:**
    - Prior to Oracle AI Database 26ai, managing schema privileges required more administration efforts. With schema-level privileges, administrators can easily reduce the overhead involved in granting and managing privileges, and improve security at the same time.

- **Developer Role:**
    - The Developer Role provides a comprehensive set of system privileges, object privileges, predefined roles, PL/SQL package privileges, and tracing privileges required by application developers.
