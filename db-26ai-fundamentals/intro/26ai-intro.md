# Introduction

Welcome to the Oracle AI Database 26ai New Features Workshop! This workshop covers some of the new features and enhancements in Oracle's long-term support release, version 26ai. While this introduction LiveLab provides an overview of the new features, keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, rather just a small sample of some of the new features in the database. If there is a specific database feature that you would like to see in this workshop, tag me on X (twitter) with your suggestion! [@Killianlynchh](https://twitter.com/Killianlynchh)

## About Oracle AI Database 26ai

Oracle AI Database 26ai is the current long term support release version of the database. This means that it is the suggested version for all enterprise workloads by Oracle Corporation. Oracle AI Database 26ai is the newest release, combining all the features developed over the past 40 years, similar to the previous long-term support release, version 19c, and the innovation release, version 21c.

The Oracle AI Database is what is called a 'converged' database. This means the database supports multiple different data types like Relational, JSON, XML, Graph, Vector, and more. Converged also means it has the ability to run all sorts of workloads, from Transactional to IoT to Analytical to Machine Learning and more. It also can also handle a number of different development paradigm, including Microservices, Events, REST, SaaS, and CI/CD, (to name a few). All of this functionality can be used right 'out of the box'. All while still benefiting from Oracles leading performance, security, scalability and availability.

Oracle AI Database was built on 3 key themes. 
* AI for Data
* Dev for Data
* Mission Critical for Data


### AI for Data
AI for Data brings in a new era for the Oracle AI Database. The goal of AI in the database is to help developers add AI functionality to all their applications in the easiest way possible, as well as adding GenAI capabilities to all of our products to help improve the productivity of developers, DBAs, and data analysts. AI Vector Search is part of Oracle AI Database 26ai and is available at no additional cost in Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition 2, Database Free, and all Oracle AI Database Cloud services.

Check out the new AI Vector Search lab for an introduction to some of the new AI capabilities in the Oracle AI Database.

### Dev for Data
Dev for Data in Oracle AI Database 26ai makes it easier than ever to develop using the Oracle AI Database. Oracle now offers multiple free versions of the database (built on the same code as the paid version) like Oracle AI Database Free, Oracle Free Autonomous AI Database on the cloud, and Oracle Free Autonomous AI Database on-premises. In addition, new features like JSON-Relational Duality Views allow you to build your applications using BOTH relational and JSON in the same app. Property Graphs allow you to build and model relations (like those found in the real world) in a new and simple way through the database's built-in support for property graph views and the ability to query them using the new SQL/PGQ standard, plus tons more features.

Check out the Developer section below to try some of the new features offered in Oracle AI Database 26ai.

### Mission Critical for Data
Oracle AI Database focuses on providing the highest availability for companies and some of the [world's most important systems](https://www.oracle.com/docs/tech/database/con8821-nyse.pdf). From functionality like Oracle Real Applications Clusters to Oracle Active DataGuard and much, much more, the Oracle AI Database allows you to safeguard your critical systems against unforeseen downtime.

Check out the High Availability section for an in-depth explanation of some of the new features in Oracle AI Database 26ai.

If you are currently using Oracle Database 19c or 21c, you can directly upgrade to Oracle AI Database 26ai. All prior versions should upgrade to 19c first, then 26ai.

Check out this lab for free access to two databases and a hands-on guide to get some experience with upgrading from different versions and architectures like non-PDB to PDB:
