Dear Mr Ford

We note that you are using the word 'pangram' in some of your "blogs".

Our client, the Pangram Preservation Society, asserts all rights to the word 'pangram' and any use of
phrases which use all 26 letters of the English Alphabet.

Please cease and desist from all uses of the word 'pangram' in your written materials, and avoid any use
of more than 12 different letters from the alphabet in any individual document.

Obviously we wish to avoid legal action if possible, but will not hesitate to protect our
client's rights if necessary

Regards

Mr Nota Chanceinhell
Legal Associate
