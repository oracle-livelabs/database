# Provision an autonomous database

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to provision an Autonomous Database on Oracle Cloud. In this lab, you will provision a new Autonomous Transaction processing instance.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Learn how to provision a new Autonomous Database

### Prerequisites

- Be logged in to your Oracle Cloud Account

## Task 1: Choose Autonomous Transaction Processing from the Services Menu

1. Log in to the Oracle Cloud.

2. If you are using a Free Trial or Always Free account, and you want to use Always Free Resources, you need to be in your Home region where Always Free Resources are available. You can see your current default **Region** in the top, right-hand corner of the page.

    ![Select region on the far upper-right corner of the page.](./images/region.png " ")

<if type="livelabs">

2. If you are using a LiveLabs account, you need to be in the region your account was provisioned in. You can see your current default **Region** in the top, right-hand corner of the page. Make sure that it matches the region on the LiveLabs Launch page.

    ![Select region on the far upper-right corner of the page.](./images/region.png " ")

</if>

3. Click the navigation menu in the upper left to show top-level navigation choices.

    ![Oracle home page.](./images/navigation.png " ")

4. Click on **Oracle Database** and choose **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

    ![Click Autonomous JSON Database](./images/atp.png " ")

5. Use the __List Scope__ drop-down menu on the left to select a compartment. Make sure your workload type is __Transaction Processing__. <if type="livelabs">Enter the first part of your user name, for example `LL185` in the Search Compartments field to quickly locate your compartment.

    ![Check the workload type on the left](images/livelabs-compartment.png " ")

</if>
<if type="freetier">
    ![Check the workload type on the left](./images/compartments.png " ")
</if>
    ![Check the workload type on the left](./images/workload-type.png " ")

<if type="freetier">
   > **Note:** Avoid the use of the ManagedCompartmentforPaaS compartment as this is an Oracle default used for Oracle Platform Services.
</if>

## Task 2: Create the Autonomous Transaction Processing Instance

1. Click **Create Autonomous Database** to start the instance creation process.

    ![Click Create Autonomous Database.](./images/create-adb.png " ")

2.  This brings up the __Create Autonomous Database__ screen where you will specify the configuration of the instance.

3. Provide basic information for the autonomous database:

<if type="freetier">
    - __Choose a compartment__ - Select a compartment for the database from the drop-down list.
</if>
<if type="livelabs">
    - __Choose a compartment__ - Use the default compartment that includes your user id.
</if>
    - __Display Name__ - Enter a memorable name for the database for display purposes. For this lab, use __XMLDB__.
<if type="freetier">
    - __Database Name__ - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. Maximum length is 14 characters. (Underscores not initially supported.) For this lab, use __TEXTDB__.

    ![Enter the required details.](./images/adb-info.png " ")
</if>
<if type="livelabs">
    - __Database Name__ - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. Maximum length is 14 characters. (Underscores not initially supported.) For this lab, use __TEXTDB__ and append you LiveLabs user id. For example, __TEXTDB7199__.

    ![choose database name](./images/adb-info-livelabs.png)
</if>

4. Choose a workload type: Select the workload type for your database from the choices:

    - __Transaction Processing__ - For this lab, choose __Transaction Processing__ as the workload type.

    ![Choose a workload type.](./images/workload-type2.png " ")

5. Choose a deployment type: Select the deployment type for your database from the choices:

    - __Serverless__ - For this lab, choose __Serverless__ as the deployment type.
    - __Dedicated Infrastructure__ - Alternatively, you could have chosen Dedicated Infrastructure as the deployment type.

    ![Choose a deployment type.](./images/deployment-type.png " ")

6. Configure the database:

    - __Always Free__ - For this lab, we recommend you leave Always Free checked if it is available to you.
    - __Choose database version__ - Select 19c from the database version. Note: This workshop will also run Autonomous Database 21c.
    - ECPU count__ - Number of ECPUs for your service. For this lab, leave the default __2 ECPU__. If you choose an Always Free database, you won't be able to set an ECPU count.
    - __Storage (TB)__ - Select your storage capacity in terabytes. For this lab, you can reduce the storage down to the minimum of __20 GB__ of storage. If you choose an Always Free database, it comes with 20 GB of storage.
    - __Auto Scaling__ - For this lab, keep auto scaling enabled, to allow the system to automatically use up to three times more CPU and IO resources to meet workload demand. This option is not available for Always Free.

    *Note: You cannot scale up/down an Always Free autonomous database.*

    ![Choose the remaining parameters.](./images/configuration.png " ")

7. Create administrator credentials:

    - __Password and Confirm Password__ - Specify the password for ADMIN user of the service instance and confirm the password.

    The password must meet the following requirements:
    - The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.
    - The password cannot contain the username.
    - The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.
    - The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used.
    - The password must not be the same password that is set less than 24 hours ago.
    - Re-enter the password to confirm it. Make a note of this password.
 
    ![Enter password and confirm password.](./images/administration.png " ")

8. Set network access:

    Network access allows you to limit connections to certain IP addresses. For this workshop, we'll set it to "Secure access from anywhere"

    ![Choose network access](./images/network-access.png " ")

9. Choose a license type:

    For Autonomous JSON Database, only __License Included__ is available. For other Autonomous Database workloads, you have these options:
    - __Bring Your Own License (BYOL)__ - Select this type when your organization has existing database licenses.
    - __License Included__ - Select this type when you want to subscribe to new database software licenses and the database cloud service.

    ![Choose license type](./images/license-type.png " ")

10. Click __Create Autonomous Database__.

    ![Click Create Autonomous Database.](./images/create-adb-final.png)

11.  Your instance will begin provisioning. In a few minutes, the state will turn from Provisioning to Available. At this point, your Autonomous Database is ready to use! Have a look at your instance's details here including the Database Name, Database Version, OCPU Count, and Storage.
