# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will get started with tables in Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service and create a API signing key for an Oracle Cloud user account and a configuration file required to connect a client to Oracle Cloud. You will build a sample HelloWorld application to connect to an Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service and perform basic table level operations.

This lab walks you through the steps to create tables in Oracle NoSQL database cloud service.

Estimated Lab Time: 25 Minutes

### About NoSQL Database

Modern application developers have many choices when faced with deciding when and how to persist a piece of data. In recent years, NoSQL databases have become increasingly popular and are now seen as one of the necessary tools in the toolbox that every application developer must have at their disposal. While tried and true relational databases are great at solving classic application problems like data normalization, strictly consistent data, and arbitrarily complex queries to access that data, NoSQL databases take a different approach.

Many of the more recent applications have been designed to personalize the user experience to the individual, ingest huge volumes of machine generated data, deliver blazingly fast, crisp user interface experiences, and deliver these experiences to large populations of concurrent users. In addition, these applications must always be operational, with zero down-time, and with zero tolerance for failure. The approach taken by Oracle NoSQL Database is to provide extreme availability and exceptionally predictable, single digit millisecond response times to simple queries at scale. The Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service is designed from the ground up for high availability, predictably fast responses, resiliency to failure, all while operating at extreme scale. Largely, this is due to Oracle NoSQL Database’s shared nothing, replicated, horizontal scale-out architecture and by using the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service, Oracle manages the scale out, monitoring, tuning, and hardware/software maintenance, all while providing your application with predictable behavior.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:
* Download an Oracle NoSQL Database SDK.
* Create a table with provisioned reads/sec, writes/sec, and GB storage and write data to the table and read data from the table
* Create an API Signing Key and SDK CLI Configuration File
* Run the Sample NoSQL Application
* An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported

*Note: If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)***

### Prerequisites

*  An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account

## Task 1: Getting started with the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service

The Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service is a server-less, fully managed data store that delivers predictable single digit response times and allows application to scale on demand via provisioning API calls. There are four simple steps to getting started with the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service.

1. Download an Oracle NoSQL Database SDK
2. Connect to the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service
3. Create a table with provisioned reads/sec, writes/sec, and GB storage
4. Write data to the table and read data from the table

You may proceed to the next lab.
