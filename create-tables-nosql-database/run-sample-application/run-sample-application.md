# Run the Sample NoSQL Application

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create a sample HelloWorld application to connect to an Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service and perform basic table level operations.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 Minutes

### About Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service

Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service is a fully managed database cloud service that handles large amounts of data at high velocity. Developers can start using this service in minutes by following the simple steps outlined in this tutorial. To get started with the service, you create a table. Oracle NoSQL Database supports Java, Python, Node.js , Go and C#.

### Prerequisites

*  An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
*  Successful completon of Lab 1 : Create an API Signing Key and SDK CLI Configuration File

This workshop contains different language implementation in the form of different tabs. Click the tab corresponding to the language you are interested in.

## **Step 1:** Download the appropriate Oracle NoSQL SDK
<if type="Java">

1. Make sure that a recent version of the java jdk is installed locally on your computer.
2. Make sure you have `maven` installed. See [Installing Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) for details.
3. Create a `test` directory. Download [pom.xml](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/pom.xml) to configure Oracle NoSQL SDK. This grabs the SDK runtime from Maven Central.

**Note:** The latest SDK can be found here [Oracle NoSQL Database SDK For Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.oracle.nosql.sdk/nosqldriver). Please make sure to replace the placeholder for the version of the Oracle NoSQL Java SDK in the `pom.xml` file with the exact SDK version number.
</if>

<if type="Python">

1. Make sure that python is installed in your system.
2. You can install the Python SDK through the Python Package Index with the command given below.
```
 <copy> pip3 install borneo </copy>
```
3. If you are using the Oracle NoSQL Database cloud service you will also need to install the oci package:
```
 <copy> pip3 install oci </copy>
```
</if>

<if type="Go">
  1. Open the [Go Downloads](https://golang.org/doc/install) page in a browser and click the download tab corresponding to your operating system. Save the file to your home folder.
  2. Install Go in your operating system.
    - On Windows systems, Open the MSI file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

      *Note: By default, the installer will install Go to Program Files or Program Files (x86). You can change the location as needed. After installing, you will need to close and reopen any open command prompts so that changes to the environment made by the installer are reflected at the command prompt.*
    - On Linux systems, Extract the archive you downloaded into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable.

      ```
       <copy>tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
       </copy>
      ```
  3. Verify that you've installed Go. In the Command Prompt window that appears, type the following command:

      ```
        <copy>
          $ go version
        </copy>
      ```
  Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.
  </if>
 <if type="Node.js">
  1. Open the [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download Node.js for your operating system. Ensure that Node Package Manager (npm) is installed along with Node.js.
  2. Install the node SDK for Oracle NoSQL Database.

  ```
  <copy>
  npm install oracle-nosqldb
  </copy>
  ```

   With the above command, npm will create node_modules directory in the current directory and install it there.

   Another option is to install the SDK globally:

  ```
  <copy>
  npm install -g oracle-nosqldb
  </copy>
  ```
You can do one of the above options depending on the permissions you have.
</if>
  <if type="C-sharp">

You can add the SDK NuGet Package as a reference to your project by using .Net CLI:
1. Make sure you have [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed in your system. You can add the SDK NuGet Package as a reference to your project by using .Net CLI:
2. Run the following command to create your project directory.

```
<copy>
dotnet new console -o HelloWorld
</copy>
```
2. Go to your project directory. Add the SDK package to your project.
  ```
 <copy>
  dotnet add package Oracle.NoSQL.SDK
  </copy>
  ```
  </if>

## **Step 2:** Download, build and run the sample application

<if type="Java">
1. Download the provided [HelloWorld.java](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/HelloWorld.java) file and move it to the `test/src/main/java` directory.

2. Review the sample application. You can access the [JavaAPI Reference Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/nosql-cloud/csnjv/index.html) to reference Java classes, methods, and interfaces included in this sample application.

  Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service tables are created in a compartment and are scoped to that compartment. When authenticated as a specific user, your tables are managed in the root compartment of your tenancy unless otherwise specified. It is recommended not to create tables in the "root" compartment, but to create them in your own compartment created under "root". Edit the code [HelloWorld.java](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/qCpBRv5juyWwIF4dv9h98YWCDD50574Y6OwsIHhEMgI/n/c4u03/b/data-management-library-files/o/HelloWorld.java), replace the placeholder of the compartment  in the function ```setDefaultCompartment``` with the OCID of your compartment. Replace the placeholder for region with the name of your region. Save the file and close it.

3. From your home directory, navigate to ".oci" directory.

```
<copy>
cd ~
cd .oci
</copy>
```

Use `vi` or `nano` or any text editor to create a file named `config` in the `.oci` directory.

```
<copy>
[DEFAULT]
user=USER-OCID
fingerprint=FINGERPRINT-VALUE
tenancy=TENANCY-OCID
key_file=<Location of the private key oci_api_key_private.pem>
</copy>
```
Replace [USER-OCID] (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five) with the value you copied on your note pad, FINGERPRINT-VALUE with your API key fingerprint, TENANCY-OCID with your [tenancy OCID](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five). The [key_file] (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#How) is the private key that you generated. You should have noted these values in a text file as you've been working through this workshop.  Use the values recorded from Lab 1.
![View config file](images/config-file.png)
When `SignatureProvider` is constructed without any parameters, the default [Configuration File](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) is located in the `~/.oci/config` directory.

4. Compile your java code using the command `mvn compile`.
5. Build your maven project using the following command.

```
<copy>
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=HelloWorld
</copy>
```
