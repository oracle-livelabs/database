# Create a Compute Instance


## Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute lets you provision and manage compute hosts, known as instances. You can create instances as needed to meet your compute and application requirements. After you create an instance, you can access it securely from your computer or cloud shell.


**Create Linux Compute Instance**

In this lab, you use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to create an Oracle Linux instance. 

_Estimated Time:_ 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will be guided through the following tasks:

- Create Compute Instance

### Prerequisites

- You have completed Lab 2.

## Task 1: Create a Compute Instance

You need a compute instance to connect to the HeatWave instance. 

1. Click the **Navigation menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Compute**, and under **Compute**, select **Instances**.
  
    ![Click compute](./images/click-compute.png "Click compute")

2. Ensure **heatwave-genai** compartment is selected, and click **Create instance**. 

     ![Create instance](./images/create-instance.png "Create instance")

3. On **Create compute instance** page, enter the name of the compute instance.

    ```bash
    <copy>heatwave-genai-compute</copy>
    ```

4. Ensure **heatwave-genai** compartment is selected.

    ![Compute instance name](./images/compute-name.png "Compute instance name")

5. In the **Placement** field, keep the selected **Availability domain**.

6. In the **Image and Shape** field, keep the selected image, **Oracle Linux 9**, and the default shape, and click **Next**.

    ![Compute image and shape](./images/compute-image-shape.png "Compute image and shape")

7. Under **Security** panel, click **Next**.

8. Under **Networking** panel, in **Primary network** field, select **Select existing virtual cloud network**, and ensure the following settings are selected:

    - **Virtual cloud network compartment**: **heatwave-genai**

    - **Virtual cloud network**: **heatwave-genai-vcn**

9. Under **Subnet**, ensure the following are selected:

    - **Subnet compartment**: **heatwave-genai**

    - **Subnet**: **public-subnet-heatwave-genai-vcn**

10. In **Primary VNIC IP addresses** field, ensure the following settings are selected:

    - **Private IPv4 address**: **Automatically assign private IPv4 address**

    - **Automatically assign public IPv4 address**: Enabled

    ![Network settings](./images/networking.png "Network settings")

11. In **Add SSH keys** field, select **Generate a key pair for me**.
  
    ![Add SSH Keys](./images/ssh-keys.png "Add SSH Keys")

12.  Click **Download private key** and save in your ssh folder, and rename the key. For example:

    ```bash
    <copy>ssh-key-2025</copy>
    ```

     ![Save SSH keys](./images/ssh-key-store.png "Save SSH Keys")

13. Click **Next**, and then **Next**.

14. Click **Create** to create your compute instance. 

13. The compute instance will be ready to use after a few minutes. The state is shown as **Provisioning** while the instance is creating.

14. When the compute instance is ready to use, the state is shown as **Running**. *Note* the **Public IP address** and the **Username**.

    ![Compute instance is created](./images/compute.png "Compute instance is created")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
