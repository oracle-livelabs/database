# Use HeatWave in-database LLM to Generate and Summarize Content

## Introduction

HeatWave GenAI supports two in-database large language models (LLM): mistral-7b-instruct-v1 and llama2-7b-v1. You can use any of these models to generate response or summarize.

_Estimated Time:_ 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will be guided through the following task:

- Generate response using in-database LLMs.
- Summarize text using in-database LLMs.

### Prerequisites

- Must complete Lab 3.


## Task 1:  Generate response using in-database LLMs

1. Load the LLM in HeatWave, and click **Execute the selection or full block on HeatWave and create a new block**:

    - To load mistral-7b-instruct-v1 model:

        ```bash
        <copy>call sys.ML_MODEL_LOAD('mistral-7b-instruct-v1', NULL);</copy>
        ```

        ![Load LLMs](./images/1-load-llm.png "Load LLMs")
 
2. Set the @query session variable with your query in natural language, and click **Enter**.

    ```bash
    <copy>set @query="<QueryInNaturalLanguage>";</copy>
    ```

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    <copy>set @query="What is the use of generative AI in 200 words";</copy>
    ```
3. Generate the response from LLM by entering the following command and click **Execute the selection or full block on HeatWave and create a new block**:

    ```bash
    <copy>select sys.ML_GENERATE(@query, JSON_OBJECT("task", "generation", "model_id", "mistral-7b-instruct-v1"));</copy>
    ```

    ![Generate response](./images/2-generate-response.png "Generate response")

4. HeatWave GenAI generates a response using the in-database LLMs.

## Task 2: Summarize text using in-database LLMs

1. Define the text that you want to summarize, and click **Enter**:

    ```bash
    <copy>set @text="<TextToSummarize>";</copy>
    ```

    For example:
    ```bash
    <copy>set @text="Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an ever-expanding field that holds immense potential to transform our societal and professional landscapes. AI pertains to the creation of computer systems capable of simulating human intelligence to carry out tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. A significant stride in AI development is the ascension of machine learning, a segment of AI that empowers computers to glean insights from data without explicit programming. By analyzing copious amounts of data and recognizing patterns, machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly proficient at forecasting outcomes and making decisions. The integration of AI is already underway across diverse industries, ranging from healthcare and finance to transportation. In the healthcare sector, AI is playing a pivotal role in crafting personalized treatment plans for patients based on their unique medical history and genetic composition. In finance, AI is instrumental in detecting fraudulent activities and offering investment advice. Furthermore, in transportation, AI is driving advancements in self-driving vehicle technology and optimizing traffic management systems. Despite the manifold advantages associated with AI, there exist apprehensions regarding its potential societal impact. Some express concern about the possibility of AI leading to job displacement, as machines become more adept at performing tasks traditionally undertaken by humans. Additionally, there are worries about the potential malicious applications of AI technology.";</copy>

2. Generate the summarized text by entering the following command and click **Execute the selection or full block on HeatWave and create a new block**:

    ```bash
    <copy>select sys.ML_GENERATE(@text, JSON_OBJECT("task", "summarization","model_id", "mistral-7b-instruct-v1"));</copy>
    ```

    ![Summarize text](./images/5-summarize-text.png "Summarize text")

 3. LLM generates a summary of your text:
