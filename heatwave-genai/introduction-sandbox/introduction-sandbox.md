# Introduction

HeatWave GenAI lets organizations easily process and analyze vast amounts of proprietary unstructured documents in Object Storage. They can develop turnkey AI-powered applications with enhanced performance and enterprise-grade data security. HeatWave genAI supports in-database large language models (LLMs), an automated, in-database vector store, scale-out vector processing, and has the ability to have contextual conversations in natural language. 

HeatWave GenAI is unique because it seamlessly integrates large language models (LLMs) and embedding generation within the database, eliminating the need for external services. This integration enhances performance and security, simplifies application complexity, and reduces costs as it runs on CPUs. HeatWave GenAI integrates seamlessly with other in-database HeatWave capabilities such as machine learning, analytics, and Lakehouse, opening up a new class of applications and providing higher-quality responses. With HeatWave GenAI, you can effortlessly generate new and realistic content, speed up manual or repetitive tasks like summarizing large documents, and engage in natural language interactions.

## About this Workshop

In this LiveLab, you will first setup Visual Studio Code. You will then create a HeatWave instance, and connect to it from Visual Studio Code. Subsequently, you will use HeatWave GenAI to generate content in natural language, summarize text, and perform vector search on your enterprise data.

_Estimated Time:_ 1.5 hours

## About Product/Technology

HeatWave is a fully managed cloud service that enables organizations to efficiently run analytics, transaction processing, machine learning, and generative AI using a single service without the need for ETL. Its scale-out architecture is designed to process data stored in Object Storage and MySQL databases, delivering industry-leading performance and price-performance. HeatWave can process structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in Object Storage. It provides the capability to create a vector store from Object Storage files and enables enterprises to utilize LLMs and generative AI on their internal content. This opens the door to a new class of applications built with HeatWave, including the ability to interact with HeatWave using natural language. HeatWave is available on OCI, AWS, and Azure.
