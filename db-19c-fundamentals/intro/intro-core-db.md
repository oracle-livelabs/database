# Introduction

Welcome to the Core Database section of the workshop, where we will be exploring some advanced features of Oracle database management system. In this lab, we will be focusing on two key topics: Index Compression and Automatic Indexing. These features are designed to help you optimize your database performance, reduce storage requirements, and enhance the overall efficiency of your Oracle database.

Index compression is a powerful technique that helps you reduce the storage space required for database indexes. It enables you to compress your indexes to a fraction of their original size, without sacrificing performance. We will explore the various types of index compression techniques available in Oracle, and demonstrate how to use them effectively to improve query performance.

Automatic indexing is a new feature in Oracle Database 19c that simplifies the process of creating and managing database indexes. This feature uses machine learning algorithms to automatically identify the most frequently accessed data and create indexes on them. We will show you how to enable automatic indexing in your Oracle database, and discuss its benefits and limitations.

By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of these advanced Oracle database features and how to use them effectively to optimize your database performance.


## About Core Database New Features Section

This section of the workshop highlights Index Compression and Automatic indexing.

In today's data-driven world, database performance is crucial, and the ability to efficiently manage indexes is key to achieving optimal database performance. This section is designed to help you understand how to compress Oracle indexes and leverage the power of Oracle Automatic Indexing to streamline your database management processes.

During the section of the workshop, we will explore the different types of Oracle index compression and their benefits, including reduced storage requirements and improved query performance. We will also dive into Oracle Automatic Indexing, which uses machine learning algorithms to identify the most beneficial indexes for your queries and automatically create and manage them.
