# Introduction

This section of the workshop highlights Index Compression and Automatic indexing.

In today's data-driven world, database performance is crucial, and the ability to efficiently manage indexes is key to achieving optimal database performance. This section is designed to help you understand how to compress Oracle indexes and leverage the power of Oracle Automatic Indexing to streamline your database management processes.

During the section of the workshop, we will explore the different types of Oracle index compression and their benefits, including reduced storage requirements and improved query performance. We will also dive into Oracle Automatic Indexing, which uses machine learning algorithms to identify the most beneficial indexes for your queries and automatically create and manage them.
