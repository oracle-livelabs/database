## About the Application Development New Features Section

This Sections lets you try out some of the new Application Development features in Oracle Database 19c. 

* Application Development
    - **JSON in the database** - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is defined in standards ECMA-404 (JSON Data Interchange Format) and ECMA-262 (ECMAScript Language Specification, third edition). The JavaScript dialect of ECMAScript is a general programming language used widely in web browsers and web servers. Oracle Database supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data natively with relational database features, including transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views.
    - **Hybrid partitioned tables** - Partitioning can provide tremendous benefit to a wide variety of applications by improving performance, manageability, and availability. The Hybrid Partition Tables feature extends Oracle Partitioning by enabling partitions to reside in both Oracle Database segments and in external files and sources.
    - **SQL macros** - SQL Macros is a new, simpler way to encapsulate complex processing logic directly within SQL. SQL Macros allow developers to encapsulate complex processing within a new structure called a "macro" which can then be used within SQL statement.
