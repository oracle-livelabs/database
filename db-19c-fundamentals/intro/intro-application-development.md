# Introduction

Welcome to the workshop's Application Development focus area! This section includes hands-on labs that demonstrate the latest enhancements and features. While this is not an exhaustive list of new features, we've chosen to showcase four particularly exciting ones: JSON in the database, SQL Macros, Hybrid Partitioning and Blockchain. Through these labs, you'll gain practical experience with these features and learn how they can benefit your development projects.

## About Oracle Database 19c

The 19c generation of Oracle's converged database offers best-in-class support for all data types, including relational, JSON, XML, spatial, graph, and OLAP, along with industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and security for all operational, analytical, and mixed workloads.

19c is the latest long term release and delivers the greatest technologies out to you. Users of 11g release 2 (11.2.0.4), 12c (12.1.0.2), 12c release 2(12.2.0.1), and 18c(12.2.0.2) can directly upgrade to Oracle Database 19c.

## About the Application Development New Features Section

This section lets you try out some of the new Application Development features in Oracle Database 19c. 

* Application Development
    - **JSON in the database** - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is defined in standards ECMA-404 (JSON Data Interchange Format) and ECMA-262 (ECMAScript Language Specification, third edition). The JavaScript dialect of ECMAScript is a general programming language used widely in web browsers and web servers. Oracle Database supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data natively with relational database features, including transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views.
    - **Hybrid partitioned tables** - Partitioning can provide tremendous benefit to a wide variety of applications by improving performance, manageability, and availability. The Hybrid Partition Tables feature extends Oracle Partitioning by enabling partitions to reside in both Oracle Database segments and in external files and sources.
    - **SQL macros** - SQL Macros is a new, simpler way to encapsulate complex processing logic directly within SQL. SQL Macros allow developers to encapsulate complex processing within a new structure called a "macro" which can then be used within SQL statement.
    - **Blockchain** - Blockchain tables enable you to implement a centralized ledger model where all participants in the blockchain network have access to the same tamper-resistant ledger. A centralized ledger model reduces administrative overheads of setting a up a decentralized ledger network, leads to a relatively lower latency compared to decentralized ledgers, enhances developer productivity, reduces the time to market, and leads to significant savings for the organization. Database users can continue to use the same tools and practices that they would use for other database application development.
