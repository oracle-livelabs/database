# Introduction

This section of the workshop highlights Online table move. Online Table Move is an Oracle 12.2 release that goes widely unused. 

The benefits of using Oracle online table move include:

Minimal downtime: With Oracle online table move, you can continue to access the table while the move operation is underway. This can minimize the downtime required for maintenance tasks.

Improved performance: Moving a table to a new tablespace can improve performance by allowing the DBA to store the table in a location that is optimized for the specific workload of the table.

Simplified storage management: Oracle online table move allows the DBA to move tables between tablespaces without having to export and import the data, which simplifies storage management.

Space management: Moving tables between tablespaces enables you to balance the space in your database.

Reduced storage costs: By moving a table to a compressed tablespace, storage costs can be reduced as the table uses less disk space.

Overall, Oracle online table move is a useful feature for Oracle DBAs who need to perform table maintenance tasks without disrupting user access or incurring lengthy downtime.
