Welcome to the Manageability section of the workshop, where we will explore Online Table Move. As a database administrator, you understand the importance of maintaining your database to ensure optimal performance and efficiency. However, traditional methods of moving tables can be time-consuming and often require significant downtime, causing disruptions to user access. That's where Online Table Move comes in. In this section, we will discuss the numerous benefits of Online Table Move, including minimal downtime, improved performance, simplified storage management, efficient space management, and reduced storage costs. 


## About the Manageability New Features section

In this section of the workshop, we will focus on Online Table Move, a powerful yet often overlooked feature of Oracle 12.2. Online Table Move provides numerous benefits for Oracle database administrators, including:

* Minimal Downtime: By using Online Table Move, you can continue to access a table while it is being moved, minimizing downtime required for maintenance tasks.

* Improved Performance: Moving a table to a new tablespace can improve performance by optimizing the location of the table to the specific workload it supports.

* Simplified Storage Management: Online Table Move allows you to move tables between tablespaces without exporting and importing data, streamlining storage management.

* Efficient Space Management: By moving tables between tablespaces, you can balance space in your database, ensuring optimal performance and storage capacity.

* Reduced Storage Costs: Moving a table to a compressed tablespace can decrease storage costs by using less disk space.

Overall, Oracle Online Table Move is a valuable tool for Oracle DBAs seeking to conduct table maintenance tasks without disrupting user access or incurring significant downtime.
