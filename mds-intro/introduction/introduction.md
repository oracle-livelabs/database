### About this Product
The NEW MySQL Database Service (MDS) is the only database service that is 100% developed, managed, and supported by the MySQL team. 

MySQL Database Service is a fully managed service, running on Oracle Cloud (Gen 2) Cloud Infrastructure. It enables you to:

* Instantly provision MySQL instances and connect to a production ready, pre-configured MySQL database.

* Automate database specific tasks such as configuration, security patching, backup, high availability, and monitoring.

* Choose from multiple compute shapes, depending on your application and capacity requirements.

* Provision fast, reliable, and secure cloud storage for all enterprise workloads.

* Set up fast, predictable networking with end-to-end network security, including a virtual cloud network (VCN).

* Monitor the health of your resources, optimize the performance of your applications, and respond to anomalies in real time.

* Access to dozens of additional Oracle Cloud Services enabling organizations to embrace the shift to the cloud.

* Free up time of developers, Database Administrators (DBA), and DevOps to focus on value-added tasks that are core to your business.
