## Task 6: Connect to MySQL Database

If you are a Linux, Mac, or  Windows 10 Powershell user, skip the first step.

1.  If you are a Windows user, click the Start menu from your windows machine to access Git, which should include the Git Bash command. select the Git Bash command.

    > **Note:** This will take you to the Git Bash terminal.

2.  From a terminal window on your local system, connect to the compute instance with the SSH command.

3. Indicate the location of the private key that you created earlier with **MDS_Client**.

4. Enter the user name `opc` and the public **IP Address**.

      > **Note:** The **MDS\_Client** shows the public IP Address as mentioned at the end of **Task 5: Create the Client Virtual Machine**. For example, **ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&132.145.170.990**

     ```
     <copy>$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&<your_compute_instance_ip>;</copy>
     ```

     ![Connect](./images/06connect01.png " ")

5. Install MySQL release package with the following command (you will need a MySQL client tool to connect to your new MySQL Database System from your client machine):

     ```
     <copy>[opc@...]$ sudo yum -y install https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm</copy>
     ```

     ![Connect](./images/06connect03.png " ")

6. Install MySQL Shell with the following command:

     ```
     <copy>[opc@...]$ sudo yum install –y mysql-shell</copy>
     ```

     ![Connect](./images/06connect05.png " ")

7. From your compute instance, connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool.

     > **Note:** The endpoint (IP address) can be found on the MySQL Database System Details page, under **Endpoints**.

     ![Connect](./images/06connect06.png " ")

8.  Use the following command to connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool. For example,  **mysqlsh -uadmin -p -h132.145.170.990**.

     ```
     <copy>[opc@...]$ mysqlsh -u<MDS_admin_username> -p -h<MDS_endpoint></copy>
     ```

     ![Connect](./images/06connect07.png " ")

9. On MySQL Shell, switch to SQL mode to try some SQL commands. Type the following command at the prompt:    

     ```
     <copy>\SQL</copy>
     ```

     ![Connect](./images/06connect13.png " ")

10. To display a list of databases, type the following command at the prompt:

     ```
     <copy>SHOW DATABASES;</copy>
     ```

11. To display the database version, current date, and user, type the following command at the prompt:

     ```
     <copy>SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE, USER();</copy>
     ```

12. To display MysQL user and host from user table type the following command at the prompt:

     ```
     <copy>SELECT USER, HOST FROM mysql.user;</copy>
     ```

     > **Note:** Optionally, you can use MySQL Workbench from your local machine to connect to the MySQL endpoint using your new compute instance as a jump box.

13. If required, in your pre-installed **MySQL Workbench**, configure a connection using the **Standard TCP/IP over SSH** method and use the credentials of the compute instance for SSH.

   - MySQL Workbench configuration for MySQL MySQL Database Service:

     ![Connect](./images/06workbench01.png " ")

4. Select one of the following actions:

    - Start: Starts a stopped database system. After the database system is started, the **Stop** action is enabled and the **Start** option is disabled.
    - Stop: Stops a running database system. After the database system is powered off, the **Start** action is enabled.
    - Restart: Shuts down a database system, and restarts it.

     > **Note:**  Stopping a database system stops billing for all OCPUs associated with it.
       - Billing continues for storage.
       - Billing for OCPUs resumes if you restart the database system.
       - If you selected **Stop** or **Restart**, the Stop/Restart MySQL Database System dialog box is displayed.

5. Select a shutdown type:

     - Fast: Flushes dirty pages before shutting down the database system. Some flush operations must        be performed during the next startup, potentially increasing the duration of the start-up    process.
     - Slow: Flushes dirty pages and purges undo log pages for older transactions. The shutdown itself can take longer, but the subsequent startup is faster.
     - Immediate: Does not flush dirty pages and does not purge any undo log pages. Stops MySQL immediately. Page flushes and log purging will take place during the next startup, increasing the duration of the start-up process.

5. Select the required shutdown type and click **Stop** or **Restart**, depending on the action chosen.

## Task 8: Delete the MySQL Database System

Deleting a database system is permanent. Any manual backups associated with the deleted database system are retained for their retention periods. Automatic backups are deleted with the database system.
