# Validate Migration

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to validate a migration prior to running it. Before you can run a job with a migration resource in OCI Database Migration, the migration resource must be validated. The validation job will check that all associated database environments are correctly set up.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Validate a migration
* Run a migration
