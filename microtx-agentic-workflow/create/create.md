# Create Loan Application Processing Workflow

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create a workflow for a loan processing application.

**Note**: A complete workflow is already available in MicroTx Workflow on your remote desktop. You can use this workflow as a reference. To directly run the workflow, jump to the next lab and skip this lab.

In this lab, you will understand the various building blocks of the workflow, such as tasks, prompts, and agent profile. You will also build a few of these blocks. In this lab, you will add multiple tasks in a step-by-step manner. Each task accomplishes a specific goal. This workflow accepts user input in natural language.

**Note**: You can also complete the tasks in this lab by viewing the building blocks and workflow tasks defined in the existing loan application processing workflow. All the building blocks such as connectors for LLM, database and MCP server, prompt templates, gen-ai task, agentic task, planner task and other tasks are already created to support the execution of the existing loan application processing workflow. You can analyze the json definitions to understand how these building blocks are added into a workflow.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

4. If you want to proceed by viewing the workflow and not creating a new one, then skip Task 2 and proceed to Task 3.

## Task 2: Create a New Workflow 

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Definitions**.

2. Click the **Workflow** tab.

3. Click **New Workflow Definition**.
   A JSON file is displayed, which is the default workflow in the left pane. In the right pane, the components of the workflow are depicted visually.
  ![Default Workflow Definition](images/default-workflow.png)

4. Delete the JSON code that appears by default and paste the following code.

   ```json
    <copy>
    {
     "name": "acme_bank_loan_processing_workflow",
     "description": "Acme bank Loan processing workflow with multi agent orchestration",
     "tasks": []
    }
    </copy>
    ```

5. Click **Save**.

## Task 3: Extract Loan Application Details

The workflow accepts user input in natural language. Use a GenAI task type to extract the loan application details from the input provided by a user. Since a GenAI task requires LLM, let's start by creating a connector for accessing the LLM.

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Connectors**.

2. Click the **LLM** tab. *You can view and use the existing LLM connector definition **openaai-dev** for the remaining tasks without creating a new one*.

3. To create a new LLM definition, click **New LLM Definition**. The **New LLM Definition** dialog box appears.

4. Click on the Edit button to view the existing LLM definition. Or enter the following information if you want to create a new definition.
    * Name: Enter openaai-dev as a unique and descriptive name to identify this LLM definition in workflows.
    * Model Provider: Select OPENAI as the model provider.
    * Models: Enter gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini as a comma-separated list of the names of the models which you intend to use.
    * Description: Enter a description for the LLM definition.
    * API Key: *Paste your OpenAI API key, which authenticates your requests*.
    * Base URL: Enter <https://api.openai.com/> as the URL to access the API endpoint of the LLM.

     ![New LLM Definition](images/openai-llm-definition.png)

5.  Click **Submit**.
    Your new definition appears in the list of available LLM definitions.

6.  In the navigation menu, click **Definitions**, and then click the **Workflows** tab.

7.  View the workflow JSON code that appears for the "Extract Loan Application details" task or paste the following code to add this task if you are creating a new workflow.

    ```json
    <copy>
    {
    "name": "Extract Loan Application details",
    "taskReferenceName": "extract_loan_details",
    "inputParameters": {
        "llmProfile": {
            "name": "openai-dev",
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
        },
        "promptTemplate": "loan_application_nl_2_json",
        "promptVariables": {
            "loan_application_text": "${workflow.input.loan_application_text}"
        }
    },
    "type": "GENAI_TASK"
    }
    </copy>
    ```

8. Click **Save**.

9. Let's look at the input parameters required by this GenAI task. It requires the LLM profile definition that we created earlier and a prompt template. Next, let's create the prompt template.

10. In the navigation menu, click **Agentic AI**, and then click the **Prompt** tab. The Prompt Definitions list page opens. All the prompts that you have defined are displayed in a table.

11. View the existing "loan\_application\_nl\_2\_json" prompt definition. To create a new prompt template, click **New Prompt Definition**.

12. Click on the edit button to view the prompt definition. Or enter the following information when creating a new definition.

   ![New Prompt Definition](images/new-prompt-template.png)

    * Name: Enter `loan_application_nl_2_json` as a unique and descriptive name to identify this prompt definition in workflows.
  
    * Description: Optional. Enter the following description for the prompt definition.

       ```text
        <copy>
        Extract the input parameters from natural language input.
        </copy>
        ```

    * Prompt Template: Create a prompt template to guide the planner's decision-making strategy. Here's an example prompt template which extracts the loan application details, such as loan amount and tenure from the input text.

       ```text
        <copy>
        Extract the loan application details like loan amount, tenure, ssn, id etc. from the input text. 
        Input: ${loan_application_text}
        Constraints:
          - Only output the structured plan in JSON format. No extra commentary.
          - Return only the raw JSON object as plain text â€” no json, no backticks, no explanation.
          - Don't extract any other garbage info. If nothing related to loan application found in input text, just mark the status as failed with message. Or else mark status as success.
        Example output format:
        json
        {
          "status": "SUCCCESS/FAILED"
          "ssn": "xxx-xx",
          "loanAmount": 1000,
          "tenure": 2,
          "name":"xyz",
          "email":"xyz@o.com"
        }
        </copy>
        ```

13. Click **Submit**.

## Task 4: Loan Application Completeness Check

Check the details provides for the loan application and terminate the workflow if any required information is absent from the user input.
To achieve this, let's add a SWITCH statement task and define the decision cases. If the check fails, send a notification and then terminate the workflow processing.

1. In the navigation menu, click **Definitions**, and then click the **Workflows** tab.

2. View the workflow JSON code that appears for the "Check loan application completeness" and the terminate tasks or paste the following code to add these tasks if you are creating a new workflow.

   ```json
    <copy>
    {
    "name": "Check loan application completeness",

## Task 6: Process Loan Using a Planner Task in a Multi Agent or Microservices Orchestration

Next, a Planner Task receives this structured information and coordinates the entire flow by assigning specialized agents and tools to handle different parts of the verification process.

* It manages the steps, such as document verification using OCR or checking the applicant's identity. The planner checks compliance, for example credit score and anti-money laundering rules. If review is required by a human, the planner notifies the right people. It also calls the loan processing task to perform other loan application formalities.
* A human task is added to enable admin cross-verification at runtime in case of any anti-money laundering (AML) check failures.

At its core, the Agentic Planner uses an LLM to dynamically decide the next steps in a workflow. You can think of it as the brain behind the orchestrationâ€”it takes in a natural language goal, understands the tools and tasks available, and then figures out the optimal sequence of actions.

Here's how the agentic planner works in simple steps:

  1. First, we give the planner all the information it needs. That includes the goal, a prompt, any tools it can use, and a list of tasks.
  2. Next, the planner figures out what to do next. It decides the sequence and order of the tasks and makes sure everything fits together.
  3. Then, the planner sends its instructions to the orchestrator, which starts executing the planned tasks.
  4. This process keeps loopingâ€”planning, executing, and checkingâ€”until the final goal is reached.

Agentic Planner requires LLM access, a prompt, and tools as input parameters. Next, let's create required connectors and prompt template.

1. Let's reuse the `openaai-dev` LLM definition that you have created in Task 2.

2. In the navigation menu, click **Agentic AI**, and then click the **Prompt** tab. The Prompt Definitions list page opens. All the prompts that you have defined are displayed in a table.

3. View the existing "loan\_process\_planner" prompt definition. To create a new prompt template, click **New Prompt Definition**.

4. Click on the edit button to view the prompt definition. Or enter the following information when creating a new definition.

    * Name: Enter `loan_process_planner` as a unique and descriptive name to identify this prompt definition in workflows.
  
    * Description: Optional. Enter the following description for the prompt definition.

       ```text
        <copy>
        Loan process tasks planner.
        </copy>
        ```

    * Prompt Template: Create a prompt template to guide the planner's decision-making strategy. Here's an example prompt template which extracts the loan application details, such as loan amount and tenure from the input text.

       ```text
        <copy>
        Your goal is to execute the loan approval. Do call the required tasks/tools to finish the loan approval process as per the below conditions:
        1. First step is to verify the documents. Do propose to only call the document verification task and parse the response for success. If the verification fails, do exit with status failed.
        2. Second step, propose to call compliance agent and loan processing agent tasks in parallel. Handle the failures in below order:
            2.a. If the compliance agent is failed due to the low credit score. And if the credit score is between 400 to 700, do propose to call the verify income proof tool with input as ${document}. parse the response for success. If the verification fails, do exit with status failed.
            2.b. If the compliance agent is failed with the AML (anti Money Laundering) check, then propose to call notify aml check failure to admin and human aml verification tasks in parallel.
        </copy>
        ```

Here are the details of a few other tasks that are used in the Agentic planner.

* The Loan Compliance microservice performs credit score and AML checks. This microservice is pre-configured and available locally in the LiveLabs environment.
* The Loan Processing agent is developed using Langraph in Python. It validates the user's debt-to-credit ratio and makes the final loan offer. This agent is pre-created and available locally in the LiveLabs environment.
* Human task validates AML failure. If the loan compliance agent fails the workflow due to an AML check failure, invoke human intervention to validate the rejection. If the user is wrongly flagged, it allow the workflow to proceed or reject and fail the workflow. The workflow will remain paused until manual verification and sign-off are completed.


## Task 7: Check the Execution Status of the Orchestrator (Planner)

Terminate the workflow if the Agentic planner fails the multi-agent orchestration. Add a SWITCH statement task to achieve this.

1. In the navigation menu, click **Definitions**, and then click the **Workflows** tab.

2. View the workflow JSON code that appears for the "Check planner execution status" and terminate tasks or paste the following code to add these tasks if you are creating a new workflow.

   ```
