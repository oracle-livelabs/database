# Introduction

In this lab we will setup an Oracle Database. For this LiveLab, we will create an Always Free Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai (23ai always free ADB). All of the labs in this LiveLab and all of the features we are going to work with today are available and work on any 23ai database, regardless of the deployment style.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objective:
The objective of this workshop is to set up the 23ai always free ADB. The following steps will guide you through the simple installation.

### Prerequisites:
- Complete the Get Started Lab.
- Basic understanding of SQL is helpful.

## Task 1: Database creation
1. Using the hamburger menu in the top left hand of the screen, **click** Oracle Database and then click Autonomous Database.

    ![locate adb](images/im1.png " ")

2. Now **select** Create Autonomous Database.

    ![locate adb](images/im2.png " ")

3. Keep the default compartment and give the datable a display name and database name. Let's name it db23ai. Next **click** transaction Processing and keep the serverless option for the database.

    ![locate adb](images/im3.png " ")

4. Double check we're creating a 23ai always free database and give your database a password. 
    > The password must be 12 to 30 characters and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. The password cannot contain the double quote (") character or the username "admin".

    ![locate adb](images/im4.png " ")

5. Lets keep the defaults for the rest and create our database. **Click** Create Autonomous Database at the bottom of the screen.

    ![locate adb](images/im5.png " ")

6. The databse in now being created for us. It should take around 5 min or less. Once its available it will show green and say Available.

7. You've now set up an Always Free Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai (23ai always free ADB) on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Explore any of the labs at your own pace. There's no specific order to follow, so feel free to pick an choose whichever ones catch your interest. Whether you want to try them all or focus on specific features, the choice is yours.
