# Introduction

Welcome to the Oracle Database 23ai New Features Workshop! This workshop covers some of the new features and enhancements in Oracle's long-term support release, version 23ai. While this introduction LiveLab provides an overview of the new features, keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, rather just a small sample of some of the new features in the database. If there is a specific database feature that you would like to see in this demo, tag me on X (twitter) with you suggestion! [@Killianlynchh](https://twitter.com/Killianlynchh)

## About Oracle Database 23ai

Oracle Database 23ai is the current long term support release version of the database. This means that it is the suggested version for all enterprise workloads by Oracle Corporation. Oracle Database 23ai is the latest build of the database, meaning it is a combinations of all of the features built into the database over the last 40 years, like the previous long-term support release version 19c, and the innovation release, version 21c. To check out some of the new features in 21c, you can run [this workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=737&clear=RR,180&session=3476722803454), or follow the steps from that guide using an Oracle Database 23ai. 

The Oracle Database is what is called a 'converged' database. This means the database supports multiple different data types like Relational, JSON, XML, Graph, Vector, and more. Converged also means it has the ability to run all sorts of workloads, from Transactional to IoT to Analytical to Machine Learning and more. It also can also handle any development paradigm, including Microservices, Events, REST, SaaS, and CI/CD, (to name a few). All of this functionality can be used right 'out of the box'. All while still benefiting from Oracles leading performance, security, scalability and availability.

Oracle Database was built on 3 key themes. 
* AI for Data
* Dev for Data
* Mission Critical for Data


### AI for Data
AI for Data brings in a new era for the Oracle Database. The goal for AI in the database is to help developers add AI functionality into all their applications in the easiest way possible as well as adding GenAI capabilities into all of our products to help improve the productivity of developers, DBA, and data analysts. AI Vector Search is part of Oracle Database 23ai and is available at no additional cost in Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition 2, Database Free, and all Oracle Database cloud services.

Check out the new AI Vector Search lab for an introduction to some of the new AI capabilities in the Oracle Database. 

### Dev for Data
Dev for Data in Oracle Database 23ai makes it easier than ever to develop using the Oracle Database. Oracle now offers multiple free versions of the database (built on the same code as the paid version) like Oracle Database Free, Oracle Free Autonomous database on the cloud, and Oracle Free Autonomous database on premise. In addition, new features like JSON-Relational Duality Views allow you to build your applications using BOTH relational and JSON in the same app, Property Graphs allow you to build and model relations (like those found in the real world) in a new and simple way through the databases built in support property graph views and the ability to query them using the new SQL/PGQ standard, plus tons more features.

Check out the Developer section below to try some of the new features offered in Oracle Database 23ai.

### Mission Critical for Data
Oracle Databases focuses on providing the highest availability for companies and the some of the [worlds most important systems](https://www.oracle.com/docs/tech/database/con8821-nyse.pdf). From functionality like Oracle Real Applications Clusters to Oracle Active DataGuard and much, much more, the Oracle Database allows you to safeguard your critical systems against unforeseen downtown.

Check out the High Availability section for an in depth explanation on some of the new features in Oracle Database 23ai.

If you are currently using Oracle Database 19c or 21c, you can directly upgrade to Oracle Database 23ai. All prior versions should upgrade to 19c first, then 23ai.

Check out this lab for free access to two databases and a hands on guide to get some experience with upgrading from different versions and architectures like non-pdb to pdb:
