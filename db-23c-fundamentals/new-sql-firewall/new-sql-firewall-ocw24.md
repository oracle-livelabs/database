# Exploring SQL Firewall in Oracle Database 23ai

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Exploring SQL Firewall in Oracle Database 23ai" workshop. In this workshop, you will learn about the SQL Firewall feature introduced in Oracle Database 23ai, which provides real-time protection against common database attacks by monitoring and blocking unauthorized SQL and SQL injection attempts. By the end of this workshop, you will be able to configure and use the SQL Firewall to enhance the security of your database applications.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objective:

The objective of this workshop is to familiarize you with the SQL Firewall feature in Oracle Database 23ai. You will learn how to enable the firewall, capture and allow authorized SQL statements, enforce security policies based on SQL and environmental contexts, and monitor for violations. Please note, this lab provides a high-level overview of SQL Firewall capabilities. For a comprehensive SQL Firewall workshop, please visit the [SQL Firewall LiveLab](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3875).

### Prerequisites:

- Access to Oracle Database 23ai environment.
- Basic understanding of SQL.

## Task 1: Enabling SQL Firewall

1. For this lab, let's create sample tables and insert data as part of our demo.

    ```
    <copy>
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS EMPLOYEES CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS DEPARTMENTS CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;

    -- Create employees table
    CREATE TABLE employees (
        employee_id INT,
        first_name VARCHAR(50),
        last_name VARCHAR(50),
        department_id INT
    );

    -- Create departments table
    CREATE TABLE departments (
        department_id INT,
        department_name VARCHAR(50)
    );

    -- Insert data into departments table
    INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name)
    VALUES
        (1, 'HR'),
        (2, 'IT'),
        (3, 'Finance');
    </copy>
    ```
    ![create tables](images/im8.png " ")


2. We'll need to sign in as a user with more privileges than the user DB23AI. For demo purposes, we'll use the ADMIN user. 

    Log out of the user and log in as ADMIN.

2. For this lab, we'll create a new user, 'TEST', and grant necessary roles including SQL\_FIREWALL\_ADMIN.

    ```
    <copy>
    -- Create USER SQL
    CREATE USER TEST IDENTIFIED BY Oracledb_4U#;

    -- Grant roles
    GRANT CONNECT TO TEST;
    GRANT RESOURCE TO TEST;
    GRANT SQL_FIREWALL_ADMIN TO TEST WITH ADMIN OPTION;

    -- Enable REST
    BEGIN
        ORDS_ADMIN.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
            p_enabled => TRUE,
            p_schema => 'TEST',
            p_url_mapping_type => 'BASE_PATH',
            p_url_mapping_pattern => 'TEST',
            p_auto_rest_auth=> TRUE
        );

        -- Enable data sharing
        C##ADP$SERVICE.DBMS_SHARE.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
                SCHEMA_NAME => 'TEST',
                ENABLED => TRUE
        );
        commit;
    END;
    /

    -- Set quota
    ALTER USER TEST QUOTA 100M ON DATA;
    </copy>
    ```
    ![create the user](images/im2.png " ")

3. Sign out of the admin user and sign in as the test user

    ![database actions](images/im21.png " ")

4. Sign in to the TEST user using credentials:
    - Username: Test
    - Password: Oracledb_4U#

    ![sign in](images/im5.png " ")

5. Click the Hamburger menu, select SQL.

    ![select SQL](images/im6.png " ")

6. Enable SQL Firewall for the TEST user using the PL/SQL command:
    ```
    <copy>
    EXEC DBMS_SQL_FIREWALL.ENABLE;
    </copy>
    ```
    ![enable SQL Firewall](images/im7.png " ")

8. Start capturing SQL traffic for the DB23AI user to learn normal activities.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_SQL_FIREWALL.CREATE_CAPTURE(
            username => 'DB23AI',
            top_level_only => FALSE,
            start_capture => TRUE
        );
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```
    ![start capture](images/im9.png " ")

9. Now sign out of the test user and back in as the DB23AI user. 

    * the password is Oracledb_4U#

    ![start capture](images/im22.png " ")
    ![start capture](images/im23.png " ")

10. Select the SQL time and perform typical SQL operations to capture normal activities (e.g., select and insert statements).

    ```
    <copy>
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id)
    VALUES (101, 'Alice', 'Brown', 2);
    COMMIT;
    </copy>
    ```
    ![perform SQL operations](images/im10.png " ")

11. Log back in as the TEST user

    * the password is Oracledb_4U#

    ![perform SQL operations](images/im24.png " ")
    ![perform SQL operations](images/im5.png " ")


10. Click the SQL tile and stop the capture once all relevant activities are recorded.

    ```
    <copy>
    EXEC DBMS_SQL_FIREWALL.STOP_CAPTURE('DB23AI');
    </copy>
    ```
    ![stop capture](images/im11.png " ")

## Task 2: Reviewing Captured Data

1. Query the SQL Firewall-specific data dictionary views to review the captured data.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT sql_text
    FROM DBA_SQL_FIREWALL_CAPTURE_LOGS
    WHERE username = 'DB23AI';
    </copy>
    ```
    ![review capture logs](images/im12.png " ")

2. Check the allow list, which will initially be empty.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT sql_text
    FROM DBA_SQL_FIREWALL_ALLOWED_SQL
    WHERE username = 'DB23AI';
    </copy>
    ```
    ![check allow list](images/im13.png " ")

3. For this small demo, we'll turn our capture logs into our allow list. This is where you'd want to customize it yourself in a production system.
    ```
    <copy>
    EXEC DBMS_SQL_FIREWALL.GENERATE_ALLOW_LIST('DB23AI');
    </copy>
    ```
    ![generate allow list](images/im14.png " ")

4.  Now we can enable SQL firewall so only SQL from our allow list can hit the database. 

    ```
    <copy>
    EXEC DBMS_SQL_FIREWALL.ENABLE_ALLOW_LIST(username=>'DB23AI', enforce=>DBMS_SQL_FIREWALL.ENFORCE_SQL, block=>TRUE);
    </copy>
    ```
    ![enable allow list](images/im15.png " ")

5. Now sign out of the test user and back in as the DB23AI user. 

    * the password is Oracledb_4U#

    ![start capture](images/im22.png " ")
    ![start capture](images/im23.png " ")

6. Attempt to execute a statement not in the allow list to verify SQL Firewall enforcement. Notice we get a SQL Firewall Violation error.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM DEPARTMENTS;
    </copy>
    ```
    ![SQL Firewall violation](images/im16.png " ")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
