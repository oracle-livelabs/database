# Provision and Configure the Cloud Infrastructure

## Introduction

In this lab, we will provision and configure the cloud resources required for the Workshop using *Oracle Resource Manager (ORM)*.  ORM will stand-up the Infrastructure using *Terraform* and perform some basic configuration using *Ansible*.  Don't panic, we'll go over how all this works while it is working.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 15 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk through of the lab.
