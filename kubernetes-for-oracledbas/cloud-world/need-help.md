## Your Oracle Account

You are provided access to our Oracle Cloud environments in some hands-on labs. The use of those environments is free of charge, and there are no strings attached. We require you to log in using your Oracle Account to use those environments.

In case you forgot your Oracle Account credentials or you require a new one, have a look at the next paragraph:

**Step-by-step guide: Create an Oracle Account**

Creating an Oracle account can be summarized in the following two simple steps.

## Hands-on Labs using SSH keys

### Why do I need SSH Keys?

Some hands-on labs will use pre-provisioned environments that may require you to log in via SSH to a specific server.
We have used a CloudWorld-specific SSH key pair to provision the environments to save you time. That way, you can start immediately with the hands-on exercises and not have to be concerned with the initial configuration.

In the following sections, we provide instructions on using the provided CloudWorld-specific SSH keys.

### Option 1 (**recommended**): Oracle Cloud Shell

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure comes out-of-the-box with a handy utility: Oracle Cloud Shell.
You can use Oracle Cloud Shell to connect to your remote server using SSH.

1. After you log in to OCI, open Oracle Cloud Shell. If it is the first time using Cloud Shell, it may take a minute or so to start up.

    ![open cloud shell](images/open-cloud-shell.png "Open Cloud Shell")

2. Download the SSH keys using wget

    ```bash
    <copy>
    wget https://bit.ly/ocw23-keys
    </copy>
    ```

3. Unzip the archive

    ```bash
    <copy>
    unzip ocw23-keys
    </copy>
    ```

   *Please note: The file does not have a file extension!*

   You will find the following files:

      * ocw23-rsa (private key)
      * ocw23-rsa.pub (public key)
      * ocw23-rsa.ppk (private key in Putty format - for Windows only)

4. Modify file permissions

    ```bash
    <copy>
    chmod 600 ocw23-rsa
    </copy>
    ```

5. Connect to the remote server using SSH

    ```bash
    <copy>
    ssh -i ocw23-rsa <user>@<ip-address>
    </copy>
    ```

<hr>
<br>

### Option 2 (MacOS): Connect using MacOS Terminal

If you are using MacOS, you can also connect using a terminal application such as the default Terminal application.

1. Open the terminal application of your choice:

   * Terminal (MacOs default)
   * iTerm2
   * MacTerm
   * Alacritty
   * ...

2. Download the SSH keys using wget

    ```bash
    <copy>
    wget https://bit.ly/ocw23-keys
    </copy>
    ```

3. Unzip the archive

    ```bash
    <copy>
    unzip ocw23-keys
    </copy>
    ```

   *Please note: The file does not have a file extension!*

   You will find the following files:

      * ocw23-rsa (private key)
      * ocw23-rsa.pub (public key)
      * ocw23-rsa.ppk (private key in Putty format - for Windows only)

4. Modify file permissions

    ```bash
    <copy>
    chmod 600 ocw23-rsa
    </copy>
    ```

5. Connect to the remote server using SSH

    ```bash
    <copy>
    ssh -i ocw23-rsa <user>@<ip-address>
    </copy>
    ```

<hr>
<br>

### Option 3 (Putty): Connect using Putty on Windows

You can also use Putty to connect to the remote server.
You must have Putty installed. [Download Putty](https://www.putty.org/)

1. Download the ocw23-keys.zip using a browser of your choice from the following URL:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    https://bit.ly/ocw23-keys
    </copy>
    ```

2. Unzip the file and copy the file ocw23-rsa.ppk to a folder of your choice, for example to your Windows Desktop.

    ![copy ppk to desktop](images/putty-copy-to-desktop.png "Copy PPK")

3. Open Putty and add ocw23-rsa.ppk to configuration settings

    ![copy ppk to desktop](images/putty-config.png "Add PPK")

4. Provide connection details (optional step 2 and 3: save the settings for later use)

    ![connect using putty](images/putty-connect.png "Connect using Putty")

You will be prompted for the username once you click 'Open'

<hr>
<br>

### Option 4 (Windows PowerShell): Connect using Windows Powershell

If your Windows 10 or Windows 11 configuration allows to run SSH in PowerShell, you can use the following steps to connect to a remote server.
More information on using SSH in PowerShell can be found here: [PowerShell remoting over SSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core)

1. Open WindowsPowershell

2. Download the SSH keys using wget

    ```bash
    <copy>
    wget https://bit.ly/ocw23-keys -outfile ocw23-keys.zip
    </copy>
    ```

3. Unzip the archive

    ```bash
    <copy>
    Expand-Archive .\ocw23-keys.zip
    </copy>
    ```

   *Please note: The file does not have a file extension!*

   You will find the following files:

      * ocw23-rsa (private key)
      * ocw23-rsa.pub (public key)
      * ocw23-rsa.ppk (private key in Putty format - for Windows only)

4. Connect to the remote server using SSH

    ```bash
    <copy>
    ssh -i ocw23-rsa <user>@<ip-address>
    </copy>
    ```

<hr>
<br>

### Option 5 (Windows WSL): Connect using Windows Subsystem for Linux
