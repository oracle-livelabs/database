# Clean up Infrastructure

## Introduction

Upon completing your labs, it is recommended that you perform a cleanup to dispose of all OCI resources created by Oracle Resource Manager (ORM). This lab will guide you to properly destroy these resources and delete the stack.

*Estimated Time:* 10 minutes

### Objectives

* Destroy Resources with ORM
* Delete ORM Stack

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* You have completed:
  * [Lab 2: Deploy Workshop Stack](?lab=deploy-stack)

## Task 1: Destroy ORM Stack Created Resources

1. Log in to Oracle Cloud
2. Open up the hamburger menu in the left hand corner.  Click **Developer Services**, choose **Resource Manager > Stacks**.
