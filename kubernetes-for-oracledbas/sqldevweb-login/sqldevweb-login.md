# Connect to Oracle Autonomous Database

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to access the Oracle Autonomous Database instance on Oracle Cloud and connect to your Autonomous database using SQL Developer Web as the Admin user.

Included with Oracle REST Data Services, *Oracle SQL Developer Web* is the web-based version of Oracle SQL Developer that enables you to execute queries and scripts, create database objects, build data models, and monitor database activity.

Oracle SQL Developer Web runs in Oracle REST Data Services, and access to it is provided through schema-based authentication. To use Oracle SQL Developer Web, you must sign in as a database user whose schema has been enabled for SQL Developer Web.

In Oracle Autonomous Database, the ADMIN user is pre-enabled for SQL Developer Web.

Estimated time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Connect to your Autonomous Database using the SQL Developer Web

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* [Deployed the Workshop Stack](?lab=deploy-stack)

## Task 1: Connect to Your Autonomous Database Using SQL Developer Web

1. The [Deploy Stack](?lab=deploy-stack) has created an Autonomous Database for you.  Click the navigation menu in the upper left to show top-level navigation choices.

    > **Note:** You can also directly access your Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing service in the **Launch Resources** section of the dashboard.

2. Navigate to your Autonomous Database, so click **Oracle Database**, then **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

3. Make sure your Workload Type is **Transaction Processing** or **All** and the Compartment is **[](var:oci_compartment)** to see your Autonomous Transaction Processing instance.  Use the **List Scope** drop-down menu to select the [](var:oci_compartment) compartment.

4. From the databases displayed, click the name of your database to navigate to your ADB details page.

5. From the ADB Details page, click **Database Actions**. ![Database Actions Button](images/db-actions-button.png " ")

6. The **Launch DB actions modal** window will appear. If you have pop-up blockers on, you have to open pop-up windows manually and turn on the radio button to allow access to the [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com) site to view the Database Actions homepage.

Congratulations! You are now connected to your Autonomous Database using SQL Developer Web.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
