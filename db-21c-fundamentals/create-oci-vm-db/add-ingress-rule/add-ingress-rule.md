# Add an Ingress Rule to Open a Port to VCN
## Introduction
This lab walks you through the steps to open a port to your Oracle Cloud network to allow access to an Oracle Database instance running on an Oracle Cloud Compute, Bare Metal or Virtual Machine instance. For example, by opening port 1521, you will allow Oracle Database clients and external applications to access your Oracle Database.

### Objectives
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a quick and easy way to create an Oracle Database 19c instance running in a Virtual Machine.

### Prerequisites

  *Note 1: If you reconnect at a later date or connect to your company's VPN, your local machine's IP address may change.*
  *Note 2: Make sure to enter your PC's IP address, not your LAN/Wifi's IP address.*

7. You can remove or edit the Ingress rule by clicking the checkbox for the rule and the clicking the **Edit** or **Remove** buttons.
