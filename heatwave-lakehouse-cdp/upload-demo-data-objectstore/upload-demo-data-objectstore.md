## Introduction

In this lab we be creating the Demo compartment and OCI Object-storage buckets used for the workshop .
### Objectives

## Setting up Demo compartment and OCI Object Storage for performing streaming data exchanges in the demo.
### Dataset Brief :
 * The below figure shows the feature vectors of manufacturing sensor data streams .The events are being generated by the producer code hosted in a compute VM. A single event contains features such as timestamp ,asset\_id,asset\_type ,process\_temp,rotation speed ,torque and tool\_wear . Based on the historical data sets and occucrance of failures, we have built a training data set which is used as a source for the ML model built on OCI.

## Estimated Lab Time:##      10 minutes

## Task 1: Create Demo Compartment

1. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Identity & Security** and select **Compartments**.

2. On the Compartments page, click **Create Compartment**.

3. In the Create Compartment dialog box, complete the following fields:

    Name:

    ```bash
    <copy>e2e-demo-specialist-eng</copy>
    ```

    Description:

    ```bash
    <copy>Compartment for end to end workshop </copy>
    ```
   *** You can use any other compartment name based up on your needs .Please ensure to create all the OCI services under the same compartment and region which you created in the step No 3.
4. The **Parent Compartment** should be **root** and click **Create Compartment**

## Task 2: Create the following buckets in object storage before proceeding. 
1. RAW Bucket :
   Bucket Name - **demo-events-raw-mysqlhw**
   
   Bucket Purpose - The the streaming payloads will be continously written to this bucket .
2. Silver Bucket - **demo-events-silver-mysqlhw**
   
   Bucket Purpose - This bucket is used by the Data flow to write the aggregated data from RAW bucket .

3. OCI Data flow buckets - **Dataflowbucket** and **dataflow-logs**
   
   Bucket Purpose - These buckets will be containing the pyspark script and data flow application logs respectively.


## Task 3: Object Store: Setting Up Storage
The below steps shows ,how to create the ObjectStorage buckets. In this task we will be creating the below ObjectStores .

1. Before running any applications the below storage buckets needs to be created in the demo compartment.
    
    * From the OCI Services menu, click `Storage` and then click `Buckets` under Object Storage

    * Click `Buckets`
       ![](images/bucket.png " ")

      **NOTE:** Ensure the correct Compartment is selected under COMPARTMENT list
      **NOTE** Ensure for the workshop make the below buckets ***PUBLIC*** .For customized set up the buckets can be marked private .
2. Bucket Details:
   
    * **Buckets for OCI Streaming Sink** 
         * **e2e-demo-events-raw-mysqlhw** - Store raw data set.
      
    * **Buckets for OCI Dataflow set up**
         * **Dataflowbucket** - host the main.py file ( Spark Application file)
         * **dataflow-logs** - Store the dataflow Application log
    * **Bucket for storing Historical Data**
         * **demo-events-silver-mysqlhw** -Store the Aggregated streaming data sets 

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
